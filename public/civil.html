The aim of the project is to model the effect of the cavity shape on the liquid transfer process, using an existing numerical simulation model. The student will be provided of the required background information and of the starting numerical model. The numerical side of the project will be integrated with some basic laboratory experiments to provide the student with a more comprehensive understanding of the modelled physical process.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>A family of multivariate representations is introduced to capture the input–output relationships of high- dimensional physical systems with many input variables. A systematic mapping procedure between the inputs and outputs is prescribed to reveal the hierarchy of correlations amongst the input variables. It is argued that for most well-defined physical systems, only relatively low-order correlations of the input variables are expected to have an impact upon the output. Correlated function expansion (CFE) utilize this property to present an exact hierarchical representation of the physical system. At each new level of CFE, higher-order correlated effects of the input variables are introduced. This methodology has been widely employed in many applications such as uncertainly propagation, design optimization, and response prediction. But so far the literature related to its application in structural damage identification (SDI) is scarce. Therefore this study attempts to present a systematic SDI procedure comprising four sequential steps of feature selection, parameter screening, primary meta-modeling and updating, and reference-state meta-modeling with SDI realization. The last two steps imply the implementation of inverse problems by model updating in which the meta-models substitute the FE models.</p>

When there are many possible variables and the software used in the modelling has a high computational demand, both in cpu and memory, then it is vital to have an optimisation strategy that minimises the number of tests that have to be run to establish optimised conditions or performance.

          <p>This project will develop a system where students use their student card to 'sign in' to a lecture, recording attendance.<br/>
            University student cards have several methods of identifying themselves.<br/>
            We could explore those and look at recognising student cards and creating an electronic register as an exercise in designing
            building access systems that might be taken on as part of a Civil or Mechanical Engineering design project.</p>
            
            <p>The student will either need some understanding of object-orientated programming, or be willing to learn as part of the project.<br/>
            Some of the development may be in coding the software to drive the card reader, which already exists. However, the brief can
            be adjusted to suit the interests and skills of a Civil or Mechanical Engineer.</p>
