          <p>Since the early 1950’s minimill technologies have diffused to become part of the current steel making climate. For example, the share of electric arc steel production in total world crude steel production has risen steadily from the lows of 15% in 1970 to around 35% in 2002. This trend has had profound implications for the structure of the steel industry around the world. The continuation of this trend will also have significant implications for iron ore and coking coal demand in the longer term.</p>
            
            <p>In this project you will research the reasons for this growth in electric arc steel manufacturing and assess the implication for the future of the large integrated plant. You will also build a model to forecast both steel scrap prices and the future growth of electric arc steel making and derive forecasts up to the year 2015.</p>

          <p>Wastewater processing plays an essential role in modern industry. Design and construction of the hydraulic structure is fundamental to an efficient and effective processing procedure. This requires a clear understanding of the hydraulic flow and its influences to the concrete structure. Also, as a long-term structure and to provide a sustainable solution, the design and construction has to takes into consideration the impact on the surrounding environment.<br />The wastewater hydraulic system consists of water tanks and networking pipes. The pipe flow is regularized and controlled by the hydraulic structure whose mechanical behavior is strongly influenced by the dynamic load from flowing water. The project mainly includes two parts: a) Analysis and optimization of pipe flows in the hydraulic system. b) Analysis and design of reinforced concrete tanks according to Eurocode.<br />Dr. Mauricio Lobao from Black &amp; Veatch Ltd. (http://www.bv.com/) will be the industrial supervisor, and a few meetings in Black &amp; Veatch Ltd. (Swansea office) may be required. The student choosing this project is expected to have a clear understanding of concepts, principles and methods in fluid mechanics and structure mechanics. The project student will face an industry project and benefit from working with professional engineers.</p>

          <p>When the wind blows, a floating object will experience a drag force in the direction of the wind. As the object is induced to drift through the water it will experience a hydrodynamic drag force in the opposite direction. Equilibrium results when the wind-induced aerodynamic drag force is balanced by the hydrodynamic drag force. This occurs at the drift velocity. The ratio of the drift velocity to the wind velocity will depend upon the proportion of the object above and below the waterline.</p>
            
            <p>This project will deal specifically with the induced drift velocity for a floating human body. The work is required for forensic analysis in a criminal investigation. In the first stage, the project will take an experimental approach using the wind tunnel and the water tank available in the School and aim to provide a quick but rough estimation of the drift velocity. In the second stage, a computer simulation approach will be taken (using ANSYS CFX, a commercial computational fluid dynamics package) to confirm the experimental result and obtain more detailed prediction.</p>
            
            <p>The project student is expected to have good knowledge in fluid mechanics, strong ability in experimental investigation, and an interest and open mind of computer simulation.</p>

          <p>The wheelchair is an essential tool for immobile people who wish to travel indoors and out. A reliable wheelchair is essential for accessibility and confidence for the user, failure of the wheelchair frame could cause serious injury and discomfort for the user. A specific problem recognized with wheelchair failure is fatigue fracture in the cross-brace. It is a problem common with manual folding frame wheelchairs. Fatigue failure causes the chair to be inoperable for the user and could cause serious injury depending on the consequences after the failure. In order to avoid critical failures in wheelchair frames, standards are set for manufacturers to follow, theses involve static strength tests and fatigue tests.</p>
            
            <p>This project will investigate the use of finite element analysis to predict the fatigue strength of a wheelchair frame. Due to the inconsistent nature of fatigue many factors are to be considered when assigning a fatigue strength property. The computer simulation will involve both both static and dynamic analysis. The commercial finite element analysis package “ANSYS” will be used as the main tool in the project.</p>
            
            <p>The project student is required to have solid knowledge in both mechanics and mathematics, with strong motivation to work with real engineering problems. From the project, the student will gain knowledge of using computer simulation to assist analysis and design of complicated engineering structures and receive training of combining techniques to solve real engineering challenges.</p>

A MatLab computer program will be developed with the purpose of investigating the effect of dynamic loads, such as wind or earthquake effects, into the structural behaviour of conventional trusses. Advanced topics will be studied such as: three dimensional modelling, linear and nonlinear (i.e. plasticity) constitutive behaviour, Newmark time integration family of schemes, damping and resonance effects, wind load modelling and response spectra. A series of realistic Civil Engineering examples (i.e. bridge, skyscraper) will be analysed under real life scenarios.</p>

          <p>A prestressed membrane structure is a structural form which, due to its own geometrical shape, boundary conditions (supports) and prestressing loads, is subjected only to in-plane tensile forces, thus compressive/shear forces and bending/torsional moments are not present. Tensile membrane structures (possibly in combination with cable nets) are most often used as roofs as they can economically and attractively span large distances (i.e. the O2 Arena in London or the Olympic Stadium in Munich). Form-finding is the process by which an initial shape is obtained in equilibrium with the prestress pattern, prior to the application of in-service loads (i.e. snow, wind). In this project, various form-finding techniques will be investigated, in the context of cable-nets and tensile membranes, and comparisons will be drawn between them in terms of the resulting final shape.</p>

The programming language adopted is MATLAB and the student will start from an existing finite element program for seepage flow analysis in 2-D. The resulting algorithm should produce quadratic rates of asymptotic convergence to the solution (the shape and position of the phreatic surface) which are well above that of simpler algorithms currently described in textbooks.</p>

          <p>Torsion in beams generally arises from the action of shear loads whose point of application does not coincide with the shear centre of the beam section. Codes of Practice require torsional stresses be checked and provided for in design. For general beams, exact solutions of torsion problems normally do not exist and approximate, numerical, methods of analysis must be employed. In this project, we will consider a beams of rectangular cross section, and begin by obtaining an exact solution via a separation of variables method. This will enable us to determine the value of the torsional rigidity of the beam. We will then solve the same problem using MATLAB and a basic finite difference method. The accuracy of the approximation will be demonstrated by comparing the computed and exact values of the torsional rigidity. To finish, we will use a higher order finite difference method and demonstrate its improved accuracy characteristics.</p>

          <p>Water hammer is a pressure surge resulting when water in motion is forced to stop or change direction suddenly. At home, water hammer sometime occurs occur when a tap shuts off water flow, causing a loud repetitive banging or shuddering. The process is often simulated using the method of characteristics. We will start by looking at the water hammer problem and will produce a one dimensional model in the form of a coupled pair of equations. We will then look at the method of characteristics and use it initially for a single equation. The extension of the method to handle two coupled equations will then be addressed. The method of characteristics will then be applied to the water hammer equations and an approximate MATLAB implementation will be developed. This will then enable simulations to be performed of the flows resulting from the closure of a downstream valve or a change in pipe cross-section or a pipe branch.</p>

          <p>This project will investigate the solution of water wave problems. Analytical solutions to water wave problems are only available for special cases. These analytical solutions can be classified in linear and more accurate non-linear solutions. Approximate solutions can also be obtained by numerical methods such as the boundary element method. This project will extend the work of Level 3 project in 2010/11 to investigate the simulation of progressive water waves using the boundary element method in 2D.</p>
            
            <p>This project will involve MATLAB and will use and extend the mathematical concepts taught as part of the engineering analysis lectures.</p>

          <p>Fragments of ancient Egyptian earthenware figurines of cobras have been found and there are suggestions that these may have been destroyed as part of ritual activity. It is also possible that they have been destroyed by natural and accidental processes. The question arises as to whether fragments arise from ritual activity or the latter. A previous project has examined the effects of dropping and crushing symmetrical items of consistent quality and has reported the statistical distributions arising from replicate tests. A batch of figurines has been commissioned to replicate those from ancient Egypt and these will have been produced in a manner typical of that likely to have been used in ancient Egypt (i.e. without the quality control of mass production). It is proposed that a series of dropping and crushing tests be performed on these asymmetrical objects. (No in-tact ancient figurines are available for the tests.) The project involves performing the tests and analyzing the outcomes in relation to the previous study. The aim is to determine whether the deliberate ritualistic destruction of such figurines is detectable.</p>

          <p>The choices of low energy and low carbon lighting are ever-increasing, as is the need to switch to them from traditional incandescent lighting. Both Australia and the state of California have announced plans to ban their use, and the EU has begun to consider the idea.</p>
            
            <p>At present we predominately just replace one or two primary sources of light in a room with one or two equally bright sources, albeit ones which use less energy. Solid state lighting can be even more efficient still, but at present not at the highest intensities. To light a room, the number of light sources would need to be increased, which has implications for how buildings are designed and laid out, and how power is distributed. In these lower energy forms of lighting, much of the cost is associated with stepping the voltage down from the line voltage to that required in the light source. Would it be worth designing buildings that also have lower voltage power lines, with one central efficient regulator?</p>
            
            <p>This project will largely be a literature research project, looking in to the physical issues associated with designing buildings to use low-energy forms of lighting, weighing up the merits of different approaches, and suggesting changes to current building design practices which would enable designers to incorporate more energy efficient sources.</p>

            <p>Once built, the v-44 Albatross will be a world outright sailing speed record contender. The v-44 employs sub-cavitating foils comprising of a pair of keels, a rudder and a hydrofoil at the base of the rudder. The boat will demonstrate an upper speed limit, or velocity not to exceed, which is defined by the incipient cavitation speed of these foils. Since the challenge involves setting a new sailing speed record, the onset of foil cavitation must be delayed as far as practically possible.</p>
            
            <p>The objective of this project is to use computational methods (CFD and FEA)to understand the feasibility of designing and building a sub-cavitating keel with an incipient cavitation speed of approximately 70 knots, and to understand the likely performance and limitations of such a keel. The intention is not to produce a final detailed design.</p>

          <p>One of the issues that developers of marine energy devices have to tackle is the way in which the devices are fixed to one location. In the case of tidal stream turbines, the devices may be held in place by drilling and piling into the sea bed or through gravity foundations, but they must be able to withstand the high currents that are present in the deployment locations. Floating wave energy devices are generally moored to the sea-bed, but this has to be done in such a way that will ensure that the motion of the device with respect to the wave climate is not impeded. This project will involve investigating the issues associated with fixing either tidal stream or wave energy devices to their deployment location, and developing a set of rules that should be followed when determining the amount of anchorage required for a particular device.</p>

          <p>Structural health monitoring of highway bridges is becoming increasingly important. However providing power to the sensors or sensor networks for is an engineering challenge. Wired power is either prohibitively expensive or too risky, while batteries require periodic replacement. One option is to generate power from ambient sources such as solar energy, temperature variation, or structural vibration. This project is concerned with harvesting vibration energy using a piezoelectric patch on a cantilever beam. Most applications of such harvesting devices consider harmonic excitation, whereas in highway bridges the vibration due to traffic is an important energy source and is the subject of this project. The direction on the project will, to some extent, be dictated by the interests and background of the student, but is likely to include the design, analysis and optimisation of the harvester, and building and testing the device to validate the modelling.</p>

          <p>Vortex shedding is an important phenomena that can have disastrous effects on engineering structures (e.g.Takoma bridge). This project will focus on the simulation of vortex shedding behaviour using computer models. The student will design a model for vortex shedding behind one or more cylinders and investigate the interactions between them. A better understanding of vortex shedding can stimulate engineers to exploit this phenomena (e.g. energy harvesting) rather than fear it.</p>

          <p>Parallel and Distributed Computing (supercomputing) is at the heart of many innovations and discoveries in science and engineering today. It is about using multiple computational resources (e.g. multiple CPUs or computers), efficiently and simultaneously, to solve large problems which cannot be solved on a single unit. Computational machines, including personal computers, are becoming increasingly distributed and therefore parallel computing skills are of vial interest in academic and commercial organizations. The aim of this project is to design a simple demonstration of parallel computing techniques. Student could design an optical or wireless network simulator, or a road traffic simulator, or the student could develop a supercomputing implementation of well-known engineering methods such as finite element methods or Markovian modeling or solution of linear equation systems; it will be left to the background, strengths and interests of the student. The student is expected to have strong computational skills and interests.</p>

          <p>In 2006-07 the House of Lords Science and Technical Committee in their report on Water Management, recommended that “the Government should consider additional funding to boost research into desalination in the United Kingdom”. This has become more important in recent times as drought is becoming more of a factor due to our drier winters. Indeed on the 2nd of June 2010, a new desalination plant was opened at Beckton.</p>
            
            <p>This project will look at the problems associated with the civil engineering of a desalination plant, such as site selection, layout, brine intake and disposal etc., with particular emphasis on building more plants in the UK.</p>

          <p>Pykrete is a composite material made of approximately 14 percent sawdust or some other form of wood pulp (such as paper) and 86 percent ice by weight. Its use was proposed during World War II by Geoffrey Pyke to the British Royal Navy as a candidate material for making a huge, unsinkable aircraft carrier. Pykrete has some interesting properties, notably its relatively slow melting rate (due to low thermal conductivity), and its vastly improved strength and toughness over unmodified (crystalline) ice, actually closer to concrete.</p>
            
            <p>This project will look at strength testing of Pykrete (made up of various compositions) to see if it practically would have any use as a building material in cold climates.</p>

          <p>Polymer-based composite materials have many advantages for use in the construction industry and yet their usage, particularly in the UK, is very low. This project should assess the competing materials, review advances in relevant composite materials, consider why the uptake by UK construction industry has been so poor and assess future usage. Some specific case studies comparing competing materials should be considered, such as, for example, pultrusion, which should be an attractive production method for making composite beam structures or joists.</p>
