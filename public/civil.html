          <p>The aim of this project is to investigate the current and future trends in desalination pre-treatment processes. These processes accounts for a large amount of costs to the process and the plant footprint.  The objectives of the project are to review pre-treatment systems (mainly filtration and flocculation) and there capability and highlight the potential problems that these processes cannot solve easily. Finally the report should make recommendations as to the most appropriate systems to be used and where potential research has been done.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Direct time integration is used widely for the solution of large deformation problems in solid and structural mechanics. Direct integration schemes that are unconditionally stable for linear dynamic problems are also used for nonlinear problems. However, unconditional stability may be lost in the nonlinear regime. The Newmark method (trapezoidal rule) is widely used but may become unstable when large deformations and long time durations are considered.</p>

          <p>Future generation of manufacturing will include self-assembly of systems. The idea is that different components or systems will attach to each other “on their own” and create larger systems. This project will consider the static, buckling and dynamic analysis of self-assembled one-dimensional systems and networks. Each subsystem will be modelled by Euler-Bernoulli beams. Given the properties of the individual systems, the properties of the self-assembled system will be derived. Finite element analysis will be used for this purpose.</p>

It is about using multiple computational resources (e.g. multiple CPUs or computers), efficiently and simultaneously, to solve large problems which cannot be solved on a single unit. Computational machines, including personal computers, are becoming increasingly distributed and therefore parallel computing skills are of vial interest in academic and commercial organizations. The aim of this project is to design a simple demonstration of parallel computing techniques. Student could design an optical or wireless network simulator, or a road traffic simulator, or the student could develop a supercomputing implementation of well-known engineering methods such as finite element methods or Markovian modeling or solution of linear equation systems; it will be left to the background, strengths and interests of the student. The student is expected to have strong computational skills and interests.</p>

          <p>The removal of hardness to avoid problems is termed as “water-softening”.  Water hardness is mainly caused by the presence of the cations calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) and is partially due to aluminium, iron, and other divalent and trivalent cations. Hardness is considered to be an economical disadvantage as it increases soap consumption and fuel costs. A number of techniques are available for water softening. This project is targeted for students with good background in chemistry. The student is expected to critically review these techniques, analyse water in Swansea  and come up with a suitable technique for  softening.</p>

          <p>Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanotubes are newly fabricated nanomaterials which exhibit exceptional mechanical properties and unique piezoelectric properties. They are promising for a wide range of applications in nanotechnology, e.g., nanosensors, electroemchanical nano-resonators, electron emission devices and reinforcing fibers in super-strong nanocomposites. The vibration of ZnO nanotubes is one of the major concerns in nanomechanics and the design of ZnO nanotube-based NanoMechancialElectrical Systems. Particularly, the nanotubes usually oscillate under initial stresses generated by external gas pressure, mismatch between different materials, or initial external loadings. Such initial stresses will reduce the structural stiffness of the nanotubes and thus significantly change their vibration frequency and associated deformation patterns. As a result, the study of ZnO nanotube vibration with initial stress is of engineering and scientific interest. In this project, the cost–efficient continuum mechanics models will be used to describe the general vibrational behavior of ZnO nanotubes under axial force. The dependence of vibration frequency and associated deformation patterns on the initial stresses will be quantified for various vibration modes by considering the initial stress-induced decrease of the structural stiffness. The outcomes of this project will bring in an in-depth understanding of the effect of initial axial force on ZnO nanotube vibration and provide useful guidance for the design of ZnO nanotube-based nanodevices and nanoelectronics.</p>

          <p>Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanotubes are novel nanomaterials which exhibit exceptional mechanical properties and unique piezoelectric properties. They therefore have great potential to serve as fundamental elements in the 21st century nanotechnology. Their potential applications  include ultrahigh-frequency nano-resonators, electron emission devices and reinforcing fibers in super-strong nanocomposites. These nanotubules are usually of slender and thin structures and work under axial loads due to external gas pressure, mismatch between different materials, or initial external loadings. Such axial stresses will reduce the structural stiffness of ZnO nanotubes and lead to the instability of these nanostructures. Indeed structural instability or buckling of ZnO nanotubes is one of major failure modes, which substantially affects the load-carrying capacity of the nanotubes and may also alter their electrical properties greatly. It is thus of great interest to study the structural instability of axially compressed ZnO nanotubes. In this project the continuum mechanics models will be employed to explore the buckling behavior of ZnO nanotubes due to axial stress. In particular, the nonlocal elastic theory will be used to account for the small scale effect on the buckling of nanotubes and predict the critical buckling loads and associated deformation patterns for the ZnO nanotubes subject to pure axial load. The effect of nanotube size, e.g., radius, length and aspect ratio will be examined in details.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>A new type of hybrid nanowires has been fabricated by coating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with functional nanocrystals. These nanomaterials exhibit exceptional properties, e.g., extreme stiffness, high strength and high electrical conductivity, and thus hold substantial promise for the reinforcing fibers in nanocomposites and the fundamental elements of nanoelectronics and nanodevices, such as ultrahigh-frequency resonators, electron emission devices, and chemical/mechanical sensors. Many of these applications depend crucially on the unique vibration behavior of the novel nanowires. On the other hand, the vibration of the nanowires could threaten structural integrity, impair performance and introduce positional uncertainty in nanostructures. Specifically, the vibration-induced deformation could result in an abrupt change in the electrical and optical properties of the nanowies, which in turn will significantly affect their proper functioning. Thus a thorough understanding of the dynamic behavior is essential for the design and application of the nanowires. Motivated by this idea we shall conduct a detailed study to capture the vibration behavior of the nanowires. To achieve this goal a new model and the mathematic strategy will be developed in the frame work of continuum mechanics to give a reliable description to the interaction between inner CNTs and coating layers. The major attention will be focused on the possible vibration modes, associated vibration frequency and the effect of geometric size (e.g., the inner radius of CNT and the thickness of coating layers) on the vibration of the nanowires. The outputs of the project will significantly advance the knowledge of the overall vibration behavior and deliver a cost-effective model for the novel hybrid nanowires comprising CNTs and various nanocrystals.</p>

          <p>Aluminum Nitride (AlN) nanowires are semiconducting piezoelectric nanomaterials, where applying mechanical load would generate electric voltage and result in the redistribution of electric charge. AlN nanowires thus are promising for the building blocks of the newly proposed nanopiezoelectronics, the smart nanodevices based on the combination of semiconducting and piezoelectric properties at nanoscale. Specifically, due to size reduction to nanometers AlN nanowires exhibit significant surface effect on their piezoelectric responses, i.e., the surface layer(s) will exert influence on the overall piezoelectric properties of the nanowires. Such an effect will lead to unique behaviors, which distinguishes piezoelectric nanostructures from their macroscopic counterparts. The potential applications and distinctive behaviors of  AlN nanowires provide impetus for a comprehensive study of their piezoelectric responses. In this project the new piezoelectric theory will be developed to capture the unique piezoelectric behavior of AlN nanowires due to the significant effect of surface piezoelectricity. This will allow us to accurately and efficiently characterize the general piezoelectric behavior of AlN nanowires and examine the effect of surface layer on the nano-piezoelectricity. The outcomes of the project will provide efficient modeling tools and a database for the future study of nano-piezoelectricity and the development of AlN-based nanopiezoelectronics.</p>

          <p>A family of multivariate representations is introduced to capture the input–output relationships of high- dimensional physical systems with many input variables. A systematic mapping procedure between the inputs and outputs is prescribed to reveal the hierarchy of correlations amongst the input variables. It is argued that for most well-defined physical systems, only relatively low-order correlations of the input variables are expected to have an impact upon the output. Correlated function expansion (CFE) utilize this property to present an exact hierarchical representation of the physical system. At each new level of CFE, higher-order correlated effects of the input variables are introduced. This methodology has been widely employed in many applications such as uncertainly propagation, design optimization, and response prediction. But so far the literature related to its application in structural damage identification (SDI) is scarce. Therefore this study attempts to present a systematic SDI procedure comprising four sequential steps of feature selection, parameter screening, primary meta-modeling and updating, and reference-state meta-modeling with SDI realization. The last two steps imply the implementation of inverse problems by model updating in which the meta-models substitute the FE models.</p>
