The optimisation of this transfer process is crucial for novel applications such as organic electronic, biological printing. The aim of the project is to model the effect of the cavity shape on the liquid transfer process, using an existing numerical simulation model. The student will be provided of the required background information and of the starting numerical model. The numerical side of the project will be integrated with some basic laboratory experiments to provide the student with a more comprehensive understanding of the modelled physical process.</p>

          <p>Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanotubes are novel nanomaterials which exhibit exceptional mechanical properties and unique piezoelectric properties. They therefore have great potential to serve as fundamental elements in the 21st century nanotechnology. Their potential applications  include ultrahigh-frequency nano-resonators, electron emission devices and reinforcing fibers in super-strong nanocomposites. These nanotubules are usually of slender and thin structures and work under axial loads due to external gas pressure, mismatch between different materials, or initial external loadings. Such axial stresses will reduce the structural stiffness of ZnO nanotubes and lead to the instability of these nanostructures. Indeed structural instability or buckling of ZnO nanotubes is one of major failure modes, which substantially affects the load-carrying capacity of the nanotubes and may also alter their electrical properties greatly. It is thus of great interest to study the structural instability of axially compressed ZnO nanotubes. In this project the continuum mechanics models will be employed to explore the buckling behavior of ZnO nanotubes due to axial stress. In particular, the nonlocal elastic theory will be used to account for the small scale effect on the buckling of nanotubes and predict the critical buckling loads and associated deformation patterns for the ZnO nanotubes subject to pure axial load. The effect of nanotube size, e.g., radius, length and aspect ratio will be examined in details.</p>

          <p>Aluminum Nitride (AlN) nanowires are semiconducting piezoelectric nanomaterials, where applying mechanical load would generate electric voltage and result in the redistribution of electric charge. AlN nanowires thus are promising for the building blocks of the newly proposed nanopiezoelectronics, the smart nanodevices based on the combination of semiconducting and piezoelectric properties at nanoscale. Specifically, due to size reduction to nanometers AlN nanowires exhibit significant surface effect on their piezoelectric responses, i.e., the surface layer(s) will exert influence on the overall piezoelectric properties of the nanowires. Such an effect will lead to unique behaviors, which distinguishes piezoelectric nanostructures from their macroscopic counterparts. The potential applications and distinctive behaviors of  AlN nanowires provide impetus for a comprehensive study of their piezoelectric responses. In this project the new piezoelectric theory will be developed to capture the unique piezoelectric behavior of AlN nanowires due to the significant effect of surface piezoelectricity. This will allow us to accurately and efficiently characterize the general piezoelectric behavior of AlN nanowires and examine the effect of surface layer on the nano-piezoelectricity. The outcomes of the project will provide efficient modeling tools and a database for the future study of nano-piezoelectricity and the development of AlN-based nanopiezoelectronics.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>A family of multivariate representations is introduced to capture the input–output relationships of high- dimensional physical systems with many input variables. A systematic mapping procedure between the inputs and outputs is prescribed to reveal the hierarchy of correlations amongst the input variables. It is argued that for most well-defined physical systems, only relatively low-order correlations of the input variables are expected to have an impact upon the output. Correlated function expansion (CFE) utilize this property to present an exact hierarchical representation of the physical system. At each new level of CFE, higher-order correlated effects of the input variables are introduced. This methodology has been widely employed in many applications such as uncertainly propagation, design optimization, and response prediction. But so far the literature related to its application in structural damage identification (SDI) is scarce. Therefore this study attempts to present a systematic SDI procedure comprising four sequential steps of feature selection, parameter screening, primary meta-modeling and updating, and reference-state meta-modeling with SDI realization. The last two steps imply the implementation of inverse problems by model updating in which the meta-models substitute the FE models.</p>

          <p>There are many applications in Engineering were software is used in design or in fundamental research to establish the optimum conditions or optimum performance. When there are many possible variables and the software used in the modelling has a high computational demand, both in cpu and memory, then it is vital to have an optimisation strategy that minimises the number of tests that have to be run to establish optimised conditions or performance. This project will review such strategies and report their performance.</p>
