          <p>Liquid transfer from micro-cavities onto a substrate is at the base of several printing processes. The optimisation of this transfer process is crucial for novel applications such as organic electronic, biological printing. The aim of the project is to model the effect of the cavity shape on the liquid transfer process, using an existing numerical simulation model. The student will be provided of the required background information and of the starting numerical model. The numerical side of the project will be integrated with some basic laboratory experiments to provide the student with a more comprehensive understanding of the modelled physical process.</p>

          <p>This project will investigate film making through multimedia software for rheologically-based data (images, video, audio, text). It will build upon some existing film systems and integrating new material for further films. The software will be developed based around Macromedia Director and will focus on the production of multilingual-multimedia systems and common user interfaces. The research is ideal for those with some IT skills and will necessitate close supervision, with instruction offered through recent films on topics such as ‘<em>Yield Stress</em>’ and ‘<em>Viscoelastic Extravagant Effects</em>’.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanotubes are newly fabricated nanomaterials which exhibit exceptional mechanical properties and unique piezoelectric properties. They are promising for a wide range of applications in nanotechnology, e.g., nanosensors, electroemchanical nano-resonators, electron emission devices and reinforcing fibers in super-strong nanocomposites. The vibration of ZnO nanotubes is one of the major concerns in nanomechanics and the design of ZnO nanotube-based NanoMechancialElectrical Systems. Particularly, the nanotubes usually oscillate under initial stresses generated by external gas pressure, mismatch between different materials, or initial external loadings. Such initial stresses will reduce the structural stiffness of the nanotubes and thus significantly change their vibration frequency and associated deformation patterns. As a result, the study of ZnO nanotube vibration with initial stress is of engineering and scientific interest. In this project, the cost–efficient continuum mechanics models will be used to describe the general vibrational behavior of ZnO nanotubes under axial force. The dependence of vibration frequency and associated deformation patterns on the initial stresses will be quantified for various vibration modes by considering the initial stress-induced decrease of the structural stiffness. The outcomes of this project will bring in an in-depth understanding of the effect of initial axial force on ZnO nanotube vibration and provide useful guidance for the design of ZnO nanotube-based nanodevices and nanoelectronics.</p>
