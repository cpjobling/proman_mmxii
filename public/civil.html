          <p>Liquid transfer from micro-cavities onto a substrate is at the base of several printing processes. The optimisation of this transfer process is crucial for novel applications such as organic electronic, biological printing. The aim of the project is to model the effect of the cavity shape on the liquid transfer process, using an existing numerical simulation model. The student will be provided of the required background information and of the starting numerical model. The numerical side of the project will be integrated with some basic laboratory experiments to provide the student with a more comprehensive understanding of the modelled physical process.</p>

          <p>This project will investigate film making through multimedia software for rheologically-based data (images, video, audio, text). It will build upon some existing film systems and integrating new material for further films. The software will be developed based around Macromedia Director and will focus on the production of multilingual-multimedia systems and common user interfaces. The research is ideal for those with some IT skills and will necessitate close supervision, with instruction offered through recent films on topics such as ‘<em>Yield Stress</em>’ and ‘<em>Viscoelastic Extravagant Effects</em>’.</p>

          <p>The removal of hardness to avoid problems is termed as “water-softening”.  Water hardness is mainly caused by the presence of the cations calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) and is partially due to aluminium, iron, and other divalent and trivalent cations. Hardness is considered to be an economical disadvantage as it increases soap consumption and fuel costs. A number of techniques are available for water softening. This project is targeted for students with good background in chemistry. The student is expected to critically review these techniques, analyse water in Swansea  and come up with a suitable technique for  softening.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>A family of multivariate representations is introduced to capture the input–output relationships of high- dimensional physical systems with many input variables. A systematic mapping procedure between the inputs and outputs is prescribed to reveal the hierarchy of correlations amongst the input variables. It is argued that for most well-defined physical systems, only relatively low-order correlations of the input variables are expected to have an impact upon the output. Correlated function expansion (CFE) utilize this property to present an exact hierarchical representation of the physical system. At each new level of CFE, higher-order correlated effects of the input variables are introduced. This methodology has been widely employed in many applications such as uncertainly propagation, design optimization, and response prediction. But so far the literature related to its application in structural damage identification (SDI) is scarce. Therefore this study attempts to present a systematic SDI procedure comprising four sequential steps of feature selection, parameter screening, primary meta-modeling and updating, and reference-state meta-modeling with SDI realization. The last two steps imply the implementation of inverse problems by model updating in which the meta-models substitute the FE models.</p>
