          <p>Following on from three successful projects last year using a Standard SOM approach this project will investigate the potential improvements of using Growing Hierarchical SOMs. Ideally, a pre-existing dataset with many individuals (>50) each with data containing several variables (>10) will be identified and obtained by the student. Such data may be performance-related or health-related.</p>

          <p>In order to understand a player’s behaviour in a sport game, it would be essential to track player’s movement and analyze it. This requires positioning techniques for players. While there are various approaches and techniques for positioning, there are different and strict requirement for player’s positioning. As players should not have any impact on their performance from signalling devices that allow movement tracking, the weight of signalling devices should be light. This creates a number of challenging issues. In this project, the review of existing positioning techniques should be carried out first. Among existing techniques, a few candidates should be selected according to the requirements. Computer simulations should be built to understand their limitations and effectiveness in tracking player’s movement.</p>
