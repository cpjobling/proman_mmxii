          <p>Nanotechnology is being applied to many areas of sport, especially in the finding of novel materials to obtain better sport equipment performances. Carbon nanotubes have been incorporated in sport equipments for the past few years, particularly by companies such as Yonex, makers of badminton racquets. The remarkable mechanical properties exhibited by carbon nanotubes have simulated much interest in their use to reinforce advanced composites. Their elastic modules is over 1TPa and tensile strength is over 150 GPa which makes them many times stiffer and stronger than steel while being three to five times lighter. In promoting their products, several manufacturers of sports equipment have advertised carbon nanotubes as reinforcement of some of their top of the line products. The student will carry out literature review in this specific topic and investigate the different challenges of using carbon nanotubes in sports equipment development and manufacturing, and also what needs to be overcome before the carbon nanotubes can be widely used.</p>

          <p>Current recommendations encourage athletes to drink at a rate that will prevent excessive dehydration (>2% body mass) during exercise.  Therefore, although individual drinking practices vary, most will finish a bout of exercise in a hypohydrated state.  If repeated exercise sessions are scheduled on the same day or the fluid deficit is large, some athletes may fail to re-establish fluid balance and consequently this may, in some situations, be detrimental to performance.</p>
            
            <p>Post-exercise rehydration has been the focus of a number of studies.  These previous investigations have typically focussed on the electrolyte (eg. sodium and potassium) content and volume of fluid consumed, but several recent studies have investigated the effects of carbohydrate.
            Drawing on some new and exciting research that has re-shaped our understanding of carbohydrate ingestion during exercise, this project will investigate the effect of different carbohydrate drinks on fluid and electrolyte balance following exercise in an attempt to determine if they could enhance the recovery process.</p>
            
            <p>This project will be laboratory based, will be hands-on in terms of data collection and may involve some long days.</p>

          <p>In order to understand a player’s behaviour in a sport game, it would be essential to track player’s movement and analyze it. This requires positioning techniques for players. While there are various approaches and techniques for positioning, there are different and strict requirement for player’s positioning. As players should not have any impact on their performance from signalling devices that allow movement tracking, the weight of signalling devices should be light. This creates a number of challenging issues. In this project, the review of existing positioning techniques should be carried out first. Among existing techniques, a few candidates should be selected according to the requirements. Computer simulations should be built to understand their limitations and effectiveness in tracking player’s movement.</p>

          <p>As robotic devices are equipped with communication units and connected through a network, they can solve more problems and have better ability to be autonomous and cooperative.  The aim of this project is to investigate networked robot systems that are equipped with wireless networks. Each robotic device has a wireless transceiver that can transmit its information and receive the information from other robotic devices. Throughout the project, it is targeted to build a simulator which can demonstrate how networked robots can achieve a certain set of tasks efficiently.</p>
