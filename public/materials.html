          <p>Specimens are available from an ancient bronze sickle. Electron backscatter diffraction and other scanning electron microscope techniques will be used to characterise the microstructure of the parent phase and second phases, notably copper sulphide. Microhardness testing will also be used alongside the microstructure determination, to gain a view of how the sickle may have been made. Some samples may also be heat treated to examine the effect on the microstructure.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Nanotechnology is being applied to many areas of sport, especially in the finding of novel materials to obtain better sport equipment performances. Carbon nanotubes have been incorporated in sport equipments for the past few years, particularly by companies such as Yonex, makers of badminton racquets. The remarkable mechanical properties exhibited by carbon nanotubes have simulated much interest in their use to reinforce advanced composites. Their elastic modules is over 1TPa and tensile strength is over 150 GPa which makes them many times stiffer and stronger than steel while being three to five times lighter. In promoting their products, several manufacturers of sports equipment have advertised carbon nanotubes as reinforcement of some of their top of the line products. The student will carry out literature review in this specific topic and investigate the different challenges of using carbon nanotubes in sports equipment development and manufacturing, and also what needs to be overcome before the carbon nanotubes can be widely used.</p>

          <p>Materials science has applications to numerous and diverse fields of research. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a bridging technology to many of these areas of research. CT can be used to investigate internal structures non-destructively; an extremely valuable tool when it's critical that a specimen remains intact.</p>
            
            <p>This research forms part of the first collaborative project between the Materials Research Centre and the Glaciology group at Swansea. The project will utilise offshore sediment cores recovered from the seabed around the Antarctic Ice Sheet. CT analysis of these samples will allow investigation of deformational structures such as fractures within the sediment body along with porosity and grain density and orientation.</p>
            
            <p>The stability of the marine West Antarctic Ice Sheet is of considerable interest to scientists and policy-makers, on account of climate change and potential for fluctuation in global sea level resulting from changes in ice sheet volume.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>This project aims to perform an atomistic simulation of fracture of copper symmetric tilt grain boundary. A parallel molecular dynamics code, LAMMPS, will be used to calculate stresses at the grain boundary as the strain of the bicrystal is incrementally increased. Matlab will be used to plot a stress-strain curve, and Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) will be used to visualize the simulation.</p>
            
            <p>This molecular dynamics simulation calculates the stress-strain relationship of copper symmetric tilt grain boundary under fracture. The grain boundary structure in this case is a &lt;100&gt; Î£5(210) symmetric tilt grain boundary.. The simulation cell is defined such that the bicrystal is pulled in the y-direction, or perpendicular to the boundary interface, to increase strain. The strain in increased for a specified number of times in a loop, and the stress is calculated at each point before the simulation loops.</p>
