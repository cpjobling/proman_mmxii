        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>When designing materials for high temperature service, the design criteria for long term operation must guarantee that creep deformation should not cause excessive distortion over the planned service life and that creep failure should not occur within such a required operating life. Such creep fracture represents an obvious &#8216;life limiting&#8217; design consideration as fracture of pipe work or other major components used by nuclear powered electricity generating plants could prove catastrophic. For this reason, studying their ability to predict the time to rupture strain has been the major criteria used to assess creep extrapolation techniques. One of the major steels used in pipe work in power generation plants is 1Cr-1Mo-0.25V. This project will compare the accuracy of the new “Wilshire” equations with some more traditional parametric techniques in predicting the life of these steels.</p>

          <p>Due to their low density and good environmental stability Al-alloys are increasingly being considered as the preferred structural material replacing steel. This trend is likely to increase further in the automotive sector in order to reduce car weight, fuel consumption and achieve lower CO2 emissions. Despite their superior specific strength, Al-alloys have only been used in prestige cars due to the high processing cost and relatively lower strength. In order to achieve widespread Al usage in consumer vehicles, strength and cost reduction has become essential. Both mechanical strength and solid state processability (thus, reduced processing cost) can be improved by grain refinement. Although chemical grain refinement is now a standard industrial practice for Al, it has limitations such as unused inoculant particles severely reduce the fatigue performance (major concern for aerospace and automotive usage). Most importantly, chemical inoculation only works for a handful of alloys and is mostly ineffective in many commercially important Alloys. Current research has demonstrated that use of high-energy ultrasound during solidification can lead to dramatic microstructural refinement in a wide range of light alloys. This promising technology can lead to a physical grain refinement mechanism that can address the limitations of conventional techniques and lead to Al-alloys with better property, superior fatigue performance and universal applicability irrespective of alloy additions. In this work the effectiveness of high-intensity ultrasonic irradiation on grain refinement will be explored in various Al-alloys.</p>

          <p>Latent fingerprints on items of evidence in criminal investigations are typically visualised by the use of a developer, which increases the optical contrast between the fingerprint pattern and the background surface. Most routine print detection work is carried out using reagents such metal powders, various dyes and superglue. However, for metal surfaces it has been shown that an instrumental technique based on Volta potential mapping using a scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) generates superior results under certain circumstances. The principal aim of this work will be to determine whether or not SKP can visualise fingerprint patterns in instances where recovery of ridge pattern detail has not been satisfactory using various chemical developers. The sensitivity of SKP versus techniques such as superglue fuming and metal deposition will be determined using a fingerprint depletion series approach.</p>

          <p>In order to maintain a strategic advantage over foreign competitors in coated product technology, the UK steel industry is currently developing high performance organic coatings with minimal environmental impact. Thin organic coatings (TOCs) are presently being investigated as one-step alternatives to using costly combinations of pre-treatments, conversion coatings and organic polymer based primer layers which contain anti-corrosion pigments. TOCs are intended for use on steel prior to the application of a topcoat and must confer a level of corrosion protection equivalent to existing technologies. The aim of this project is to identify promising coating systems for use as TOCs at thicknesses of 5 microns or less, along with appropriate methods of application. The most promising candidates will be used to coat relevant metal substrates on a laboratory scale and will be assessed with respect to corrosion resistance using a combination of time-lapse photography and in-situ scanning Kelvin probe analysis. It should be noted that this work will be carried out within the SPECIFIC laboratories in Baglan and that the student should have his or her own transport.</p>

          <p>Polymer photovoltaics have been suggested in recent years as the answer to expensive and rigid photovoltaics that incur high manufacturing costs. Polymer photovoltaics are lightweight and lend themselves to flexible substrates The project will specifically look at the manufacture and design principles of polymer photovoltaics to develop an understanding of stability and efficiency when compared to existing flexible photovoltaic technology. The project will involve polymer solar cell manufacture and characterisation using equipment available at the SPECIFIC laboratories. Solar cells will be built by the solution deposition of organic semiconductor polymer blends between two metallic conductors and characterised using solar simulator instrumentation. The project will form part of increasing activity in the SPECIFIC centre on flexible solar cells as building integrated functional coatings.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) have often been described as artificial photosynthesis. A DSC generally consists of a mesoporous TiO layer with a sunlight absorbing dye (much like chlorophyll in green leaves) adsorbed to its surface deposited onto a conducting substrate. An electrolyte solution surrounding the TiO2 and connecting it to a platinised counter electrode completes the photovoltaic circuit. The project will entail developing an understanding into the effects of transferring conventional rigid glass based dye-sensitized solar cell technology onto flexible substrates and any photovoltaic losses. The project will involve the manufacture of rigid and flexible dye-sensitized solar cells on glass and titanium substrates and their characterisation with a particular interest on the substrate - TiO2 interface. This project will be embedded in the SPECIFIC centre within a larger activity aimed at developing energy generating functional coatings for the built environment.</p>

This project should aim to investigate these conditions concentrating on a limited combination of material and environments. It is planned to carry out experiments to investigate the effects of stress and environment individually by stressing samples prior to immersion in the environment and immersing other samples prior to application of the stress. This combination of experiments should help to throw light on our understanding of the mechanisms and the relative significance of stress/strain levels and environmental conditions.</p>

This project will concentrate on the development of new metallic alloy and organic anti-corrosion coating. Coatings produced will be characterised using SEM, and optical techniques to determine their structure.

          <p>The student will research the introduction of high-performance (low weight, high strength etc.) materials in the fabrication of vehicles for competitive motor sport. It is anticipated that part of this project would involve an historical review – for example the introduction of low weight magnesium engine castings is surprisingly early. However, the main part of the project should involve a description and reasoned analysis of the current state of the art (use of composites etc.) and anticipated future developments. The student will be allowed to emphasis those aspects of motor sport which are of the greatest personal interest (F1, rally etc.).</p>

          <p>What is it that materials scientists do? We can look back in time and investigate how and why things have failed. Utilising cutting-edge technology and materials expertise to unravel the complex histories of materials. These can be aircraft failure investigations, corrosion of structures, or even the historical processes that resulted in the damage of ancient relics.</p>
            
            <p>This research, collaborating with Egyptology at Swansea on a high-profile project, will be the first of its kind, forging an exciting new avenue of materials research.</p>
            
            <p>The project will take replicas of eqyptian ceramic relics and devise methods of fracturing them that mimic ways in which they may have been broken in ancient Egypt. The resulting fracture surfaces will then be investigated utilising both conventional and scanning electron microscopy to determine the failure mechanisms and relate those to historical artefacts.</p>

          <p>Materials science has applications to numerous and diverse fields of research. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a bridging technology to many of these areas of research. CT can be used to investigate internal structures non-destructively; an extremely valuable tool when it&#8217;s critical that a specimen remains intact.</p>
            
            <p>This research forms part of the first collaborative project between the Materials Research Centre and the Glaciology group at Swansea. The project will utilise offshore sediment cores recovered from the seabed around the Antarctic Ice Sheet. CT analysis of these samples will allow investigation of deformational structures such as fractures within the sediment body along with porosity and grain density and orientation.</p>
            
            <p>The stability of the marine West Antarctic Ice Sheet is of considerable interest to scientists and policy-makers, on account of climate change and potential for fluctuation in global sea level resulting from changes in ice sheet volume.</p>

          <p>This project proposes the response surface method for finite element model updating. The response surface method is implemented by approximating the finite element model surface response equation by adaptive high dimensional model representation (HDMR). The updated parameters of the finite element model were calculated using genetic algorithm by optimizing the surface response equation. The proposed method will then be compared with the existing methods that use simulated annealing or genetic algorithm together with a full finite element model for finite element model updating. The proposed method will be tested on an aircraft wing structure. It is anticipated that the proposed method will provide the updated natural frequencies and mode shapes that were of the same order of accuracy as those given by simulated annealing and genetic algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed approach would provide an efficient computational tool compared with the genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing.</p>

          <p>This project aims to perform an atomistic simulation of fracture of copper symmetric tilt grain boundary. A parallel molecular dynamics code, LAMMPS, will be used to calculate stresses at the grain boundary as the strain of the bicrystal is incrementally increased. Matlab will be used to plot a stress-strain curve, and Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) will be used to visualize the simulation.</p>
            
            <p>This molecular dynamics simulation calculates the stress-strain relationship of copper symmetric tilt grain boundary under fracture. The grain boundary structure in this case is a &#60;100&#62; Σ5(210) symmetric tilt grain boundary.. The simulation cell is defined such that the bicrystal is pulled in the y-direction, or perpendicular to the boundary interface, to increase strain. The strain in increased for a specified number of times in a loop, and the stress is calculated at each point before the simulation loops.</p>
