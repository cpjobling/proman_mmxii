        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>When designing materials for high temperature service, the design criteria for long term operation must guarantee that creep deformation should not cause excessive distortion over the planned service life and that creep failure should not occur within such a required operating life. Such creep fracture represents an obvious &#8216;life limiting&#8217; design consideration as fracture of pipe work or other major components used by nuclear powered electricity generating plants could prove catastrophic. For this reason, studying their ability to predict the time to rupture strain has been the major criteria used to assess creep extrapolation techniques. One of the major steels used in pipe work in power generation plants is 1Cr-1Mo-0.25V. This project will compare the accuracy of the new “Wilshire” equations with some more traditional parametric techniques in predicting the life of these steels.</p>

          <p>The aerospace industry often places extreme demands on materials engineers, with more exotic alloys often required to fulfill the requirements of high temperature/low weights applications. The role of the student in this project will be to collate a wide range of alloys and produce a database in terms of microstructure, mechanical test results (ranked appropriately) and application. The student will be required to perform a significant literature review in order to produce this database, whilst at the same time understanding/performing appropriate polishing/etching procedures to reveal the microstructure of the alloys.</p>

          <p>Due to their low density and good environmental stability Al-alloys are increasingly being considered as the preferred structural material replacing steel. This trend is likely to increase further in the automotive sector in order to reduce car weight, fuel consumption and achieve lower CO2 emissions. Despite their superior specific strength, Al-alloys have only been used in prestige cars due to the high processing cost and relatively lower strength. In order to achieve widespread Al usage in consumer vehicles, strength and cost reduction has become essential. Both mechanical strength and solid state processability (thus, reduced processing cost) can be improved by grain refinement. Although chemical grain refinement is now a standard industrial practice for Al, it has limitations such as unused inoculant particles severely reduce the fatigue performance (major concern for aerospace and automotive usage). Most importantly, chemical inoculation only works for a handful of alloys and is mostly ineffective in many commercially important Alloys. Current research has demonstrated that use of high-energy ultrasound during solidification can lead to dramatic microstructural refinement in a wide range of light alloys. This promising technology can lead to a physical grain refinement mechanism that can address the limitations of conventional techniques and lead to Al-alloys with better property, superior fatigue performance and universal applicability irrespective of alloy additions. In this work the effectiveness of high-intensity ultrasonic irradiation on grain refinement will be explored in various Al-alloys.</p>

          <p>Latent fingerprints on items of evidence in criminal investigations are typically visualised by the use of a developer, which increases the optical contrast between the fingerprint pattern and the background surface. Most routine print detection work is carried out using reagents such metal powders, various dyes and superglue. However, for metal surfaces it has been shown that an instrumental technique based on Volta potential mapping using a scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) generates superior results under certain circumstances. The principal aim of this work will be to determine whether or not SKP can visualise fingerprint patterns in instances where recovery of ridge pattern detail has not been satisfactory using various chemical developers. The sensitivity of SKP versus techniques such as superglue fuming and metal deposition will be determined using a fingerprint depletion series approach.</p>

          <p>In order to maintain a strategic advantage over foreign competitors in coated product technology, the UK steel industry is currently developing high performance organic coatings with minimal environmental impact. Thin organic coatings (TOCs) are presently being investigated as one-step alternatives to using costly combinations of pre-treatments, conversion coatings and organic polymer based primer layers which contain anti-corrosion pigments. TOCs are intended for use on steel prior to the application of a topcoat and must confer a level of corrosion protection equivalent to existing technologies. The aim of this project is to identify promising coating systems for use as TOCs at thicknesses of 5 microns or less, along with appropriate methods of application. The most promising candidates will be used to coat relevant metal substrates on a laboratory scale and will be assessed with respect to corrosion resistance using a combination of time-lapse photography and in-situ scanning Kelvin probe analysis. It should be noted that this work will be carried out within the SPECIFIC laboratories in Baglan and that the student should have his or her own transport.</p>

This project is in collaboration with the world&#8217;s largest supplier of tree shelters and a German University, where a large field trial is underway in Southern Germany. Samples from this trial are available for testing and analysis, and the results will lead to a much better control of the lifetime.

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) have often been described as artificial photosynthesis. A DSC generally consists of a mesoporous TiO layer with a sunlight absorbing dye (much like chlorophyll in green leaves) adsorbed to its surface deposited onto a conducting substrate. An electrolyte solution surrounding the TiO2 and connecting it to a platinised counter electrode completes the photovoltaic circuit. The project will entail developing an understanding into the effects of transferring conventional rigid glass based dye-sensitized solar cell technology onto flexible substrates and any photovoltaic losses. The project will involve the manufacture of rigid and flexible dye-sensitized solar cells on glass and titanium substrates and their characterisation with a particular interest on the substrate - TiO2 interface. This project will be embedded in the SPECIFIC centre within a larger activity aimed at developing energy generating functional coatings for the built environment.</p>

          <p>Microstructure-Mechanical Property relationships in High Strength Low Alloy Strip steels for Automotive Applications Description: Dual Phase strip steels are of interest to the automotive industry, due to excellent combination of mechanical properties, permitting the down gauging of automotive components, resulting in lightweight vehicles (environmentally friendly automotives). This unique performance is introduced by the incorporation of small amounts of martensite in the primarily ferritic microstructure. As part of this project you will perform an experimental study of optimising the processing route of a number of High Strength DP grades (600-1400MPa UTS), via a series of carefully controlled annealing experiments.</p>
            
            <p>You will perform a detailed characterisation of the obtained microstructures, using Light Optical and SEM microscopy and assess the mechanical properties of heat-treated samples, via hardness and tensile testing.</p>
            
            <p>The overall aim of the project will be to establish the optimum-processing route, for each DP grade studied, which results in optimum mechanical properties. Resources required: HSLA cold Rolled strip Steel grades, access to vacuum furnace heat treatment, workshop facilities, electron microscopy units, Mechanical property facilities and metallographic preparation facilities</p>

          <p>The aim of this project is to optimize the growth parameters of ZnO nanostructures by the hydrothermal method. ZnO nanoparticles are currently used in the paints and cosmetics industry. Novel ZnO nanostructures such as nanowires have many potential applications and are ideal building blocks for nanoscale devices. Because of their small size, they have novel and exciting properties that can be harnessed into these nano-devices, with potential applications in many areas such as gas sensing, bio-sensing, nanomedicine, electronics and optoelectronics. Hydrothermal growth is a cheap, low temperature technique, where various chemicals react in heated water to form the nanostructures. It normally requires growth times of several hours but can be dramatically speeded up (5-10 mins) using a conventional microwave oven to heat the solution. During this project, the student will perform the chemical reaction and investigate the effect of the various parameters (microwave power, chemical concentration, growth time, substrates) on the growth products, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to characterise the nanostructures.</p>
