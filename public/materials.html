        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Due to their low density and good environmental stability Al-alloys are increasingly being considered as the preferred structural material replacing steel. This trend is likely to increase further in the automotive sector in order to reduce car weight, fuel consumption and achieve lower CO2 emissions. Despite their superior specific strength, Al-alloys have only been used in prestige cars due to the high processing cost and relatively lower strength. In order to achieve widespread Al usage in consumer vehicles, strength and cost reduction has become essential. Both mechanical strength and solid state processability (thus, reduced processing cost) can be improved by grain refinement. Although chemical grain refinement is now a standard industrial practice for Al, it has limitations such as unused inoculant particles severely reduce the fatigue performance (major concern for aerospace and automotive usage). Most importantly, chemical inoculation only works for a handful of alloys and is mostly ineffective in many commercially important Alloys. Current research has demonstrated that use of high-energy ultrasound during solidification can lead to dramatic microstructural refinement in a wide range of light alloys. This promising technology can lead to a physical grain refinement mechanism that can address the limitations of conventional techniques and lead to Al-alloys with better property, superior fatigue performance and universal applicability irrespective of alloy additions. In this work the effectiveness of high-intensity ultrasonic irradiation on grain refinement will be explored in various Al-alloys.</p>
