        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Desalination involves several technologies used to remove excess salts and other minerals from water. The aim of this process is to produce relatively freshwater from seawater suitable for agriculture and animal consumption. In cases where almost all the salt is processed out of the feed water, it may be suitable for human consumption. Desalination provides a sustainable source of freshwater for countries with limited water supplies especially in the arid regions or in times of long drought. . This project is targeted for students with good background in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering and/or chemistry. The student is expected to critically review thermal desalination techniques showing their advantages and disadvantages in terms of effectiveness and energy costs.</p>
