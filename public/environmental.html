          <p>One of the challenges of the sludge disposal is the high nutrient content of of the fluids from anaerobic digesters. With the ever increasing values and impact of phosphate and ammonia, these materials could be recovered from digester fluids. This project is to review the potential process that could be used to recovery ammonia and phosphates from AD sludge and the potential benefits of these processes. The impacts are considerable considering the problems with phosphate mining and the production of ammonia by conventional; catalytic systems (high C footprint, diminishing resources etc)</p>

          <p>Desalination involves several technologies used to remove excess salts and other minerals from water. The aim of this process is to produce relatively freshwater from seawater suitable for agriculture and animal consumption. In cases where almost all the salt is processed out of the feed water, it may be suitable for human consumption. Desalination provides a sustainable source of freshwater for countries with limited water supplies especially in the arid regions or in times of long drought. . This project is targeted for students with good background in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering and/or chemistry. The student is expected to critically review thermal desalination techniques showing their advantages and disadvantages in terms of effectiveness and energy costs.</p>

          <p>Membrane technology is applied in many sectors including water treatment, food, pharmaceutical industries. There are a number of types of membranes modules including spiral wound which suffers from deposition of unwanted materials (fouling) leading to a huge reduction in efficiency.  This project is targeted for students with good background in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering and/or chemistry. The student is expected to critically review fouling in spiral wound membranes and consequences in terms of operation and costs.</p>
