        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Geometrically-necessary dislocation (GND) content can be determined by the effect of dislocations on the lattice curvature of a crystal. Local orientations are measured using Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), which are then used to determine the local orientation gradients and resolved into the GND content. There is experimental evidence that GND content accumulates at grain boundaries during plastic deformation, the magnitude of which may be related to the geometry of the grain boundary. The objective of this project will be to determine any relationship between the GND content accumulated at a grain boundary and the grain boundary character in strained and annealed samples of copper. The student will use orientation data obtained using EBSD to create maps of GND content in the sample. The student will then use image analysis software to obtain plots of GND content as a function of distance from the boundary. Once a sufficient number of boundaries are measured in this manner, the data will be compiled according to the boundary geometry and character as well as the amount of induced strain. This project is also suitable for Materials or Mechanical students.</p>

          <p>During long duration, low temperature anneals there is evidence that the dihedral angles around triple junctions can change, allowing the boundaries to lie in lower energy positions.  The objective of this project is to devise a method to measure the change in these dihedral angles, for body-centred cubic metals, before and after long duration, low temperature anneals.  Conclusions are to then be drawn from the observations in regard to change in dihedral angle and grain boundary energies. This project is also suitable for Materials or Mechanical students.</p>

Alternative modeling approaches shall include viscoplastic (yield stress), viscoelastic and visco-elasto-plastic (yield stress and memory) idealisations.

          <p>Trusses are widely used in aerospace, mechanical and civil engineering. Optimal design of these trusses can be done using performance criteria, such as stiffness, strength and weight. Although these are valid criteria, cost is becoming an increasingly important factor. Some of the cost is linearly linked to the weight of the structure. Other cost factors are more difficult to quantify. The aim of this project is to develop a cost model for trusses with an emphasis on manufacturing cost, and here by concentrating on the cost of manufacture of joints. The overall cost model is to be implemented in Matlab so that it can be used in in-house truss optimization programmes.</p>

          <p>Most problems in structural optimization must be formulated as constrained problems. In a typical structural design problem the objective function is a fairly simple function of the design variables (e.g., weight), but the design has to satisfy a host of stress, displacement, buckling, and frequency constraints. These constraints are usually complex functions of the design variables available only from an analysis of a ﬁnite element model of the structure.
            The objective of this work is to explore the features of the Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser function and investigate the usability of this special function in optimization. The project will involve extensive programming in Matlab.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>A typical aircraft is full of sensors and measurement devices that record every aspect of a flight every second. Sometimes this data is monitored live by engine manufacturers. The main objective is to discover abnormal behaviour of systems even though its occurrence is very rare.</p>
            
            <p>This project will review challenges in data measurement and capture along with time series models that are used to make sense from this data. The student also has an opportunity to develop some of the simple models in MATLAB to enhance his/her understanding in this subject. The technical skills developed in this project are generic and can be applied to number of other fields.</p>
