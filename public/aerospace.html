            Aircrafts, and in particular spacecrafts, to be developed in the future will have various NEMS and MEMS devices for enhanced performance. The function of NEMS (nano electro mechanical systems) and MEMS (micro electro mechanical systems) devices require superior sensing capabilities. The current generation of sensors can only identify mass based on based on frequency shift. This project will generate new methods to detect rotary inertia of the system.

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Geometrically-necessary dislocation (GND) content can be determined by the effect of dislocations on the lattice curvature of a crystal. Local orientations are measured using Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), which are then used to determine the local orientation gradients and resolved into the GND content. There is experimental evidence that GND content accumulates at grain boundaries during plastic deformation, the magnitude of which may be related to the geometry of the grain boundary. The objective of this project will be to determine any relationship between the GND content accumulated at a grain boundary and the grain boundary character in strained and annealed samples of copper. The student will use orientation data obtained using EBSD to create maps of GND content in the sample. The student will then use image analysis software to obtain plots of GND content as a function of distance from the boundary. Once a sufficient number of boundaries are measured in this manner, the data will be compiled according to the boundary geometry and character as well as the amount of induced strain. This project is also suitable for Materials or Mechanical students.</p>

          <p>During long duration, low temperature anneals there is evidence that the dihedral angles around triple junctions can change, allowing the boundaries to lie in lower energy positions. The objective of this project is to devise a method to measure the change in these dihedral angles, for body-centred cubic metals, before and after long duration, low temperature anneals. Conclusions are to then be drawn from the observations in regard to change in dihedral angle and grain boundary energies. This project is also suitable for Materials or Mechanical students.</p>

          <p>Panel methods are part of a more general class of numerical method for the solution of incompressible flow past airfoils. They have the advantage that these models only require discretisation of the geometry and do not require the discretisation of the flow body. Other numerical methods for incompressible irrotational flow require a insertion of a cut to correcting model lift, but panel methods do not.</p>

          <p>The hexagonal close packed nature of the alpha phase titanium lattice leads to the development of a strong crystallographic texture within a number of titanium alloys. This may lead to anisotropic mechanical properties which require full evaluation prior to implementation in engineering applications. Currently there is much focus on the development of â€˜macrozonesâ€™, areas of common crystallographic orientation which may have a further detrimental effect on mechanical properties. The student will be required to work alongside existing researchers in analysing material behaviour from a number of different microstructural titanium variants. The ultimate aim of the project is the development of understanding of the behaviour of these macrozones, which would lead to an overall improvement in properties which could be beneficial to the aerospace and other sectors.</p>

          <p>The recently developed Wilshire equations have shown great promise in the creep lifing of a number of different alloys, particularly in the prediction of long term creep behavior based on short term predictions. However, the creep lifing requirements for the aerospace sector differ significantly from the long term nature of the power industry. More important here is the accurate prediction of times to particular strains. Based on these results it has been shown that it is possible to regenerate full creep curves based on limited data. Clearly the Wilshire equations offer exciting new opportunities for the field of creep research. The role of the student in this project will be to work alongside existing researchers in further developing the Wilshire equations for use in the aerospace sector.</p>

          <p>A variety of designs have been suggested for morphing wings, including compliant ribs, span extension and morphing winglets. These concepts usually require a skin that is flexible, so that the wing can deform, and stiff to withstand the aerodynamic loads. One option to satisfy these conflicting requirements is to employ skins with anisotropic properties, such as corrugated skins or stiffened elastomer skins. This project will consider the design of an elastomer skin to cover a honeycomb wing structure. The direction on the project will, to some extent, be dictated by the interests and background of the student, but is likely to include modelling of the skin deformation and actuator force requirements, the design of suitable skins for typical applications and/or manufacturing and testing stiffened elastomer skins.</p>

Students will design several different geometries of smart material based composite wings. The smart material based wings will be compared to ones that have servo-motor based conventional control surfaces. An advanced wind tunnel force, moment and displacement measurement setup and an automated data acquisition setup (NI hardware, LabView) will be available for the project. Some working models and the wind tunnel setup can be viewed in the wind tunnel lab in Talbot Building. Please contact Prof Friswell or Dr Onur Bilgen (o.bilgen@swansea.ac.uk) to arrange a lab tour. No aircraft background required, however students should be comfortable with design and analysis software (Matlab, Ansys, Solid Works, other CAD packages, LabView, etc.), simple electrical circuits (resistors, capacitors, simple wiring, etc.), fabrication techniques (bonding, vacuum bagging, manual fabrication, etc.) and have an exceptional work ethic.</p>

          <p>Aircraft wings are a compromise that allows the aircraft to fly at a range of flight conditions, but the performance at each condition is sub-optimal. Morphing allows a wing to change its geometry during flight to reduce the design compromises required. Although many concepts have been researched few have entered surface, partly because of certification issues, but also because the benefits of the morphing aircraft have not been demonstrated. This project will consider one of the morphing concepts (for example variable camber, span extension, variable twist, morphing winglets) and a common mission profile (for example UAV surveillance, long range endurance, commercial short/medium/long haul) and investigate the advantages and disadvantages of morphing aircraft by comparing the performance to the optimum conventional solution.</p>

          <p>The description of complex aircraft structures is inevitably associated with some amount of uncertainty in specifying mass. The uncertainty of mass arises from variable cargos and passengers which are generally not known precisely during the design. The aim of the project is (a) to quantify the effect of mass uncertainty on the vibration response of the system, and (b) to validate and update the numerical (finite element) model in the light of such uncertainties. Vibration analysis will be conducted on simplified structures (for example, a cantilever beam and plate). Uncertainty will be simulated using randomly placed lightweight spring-mass oscillators on these structures. Statistical analysis of the response will be compared against finite element models with uncertain parameters. This project will result enhanced understanding of uncertainty quantification and model validation essential for future generation of aircraft design.</p>

The timing of the PhD studentships will coincide with the installation of the new Â£600k equipment and the studentships will be an ideal way to generate early momentum and ensure that the facilities have dedicated users who are trained by the equipment manufacturers and will generate immediate outputs for CNH.</p>

          <p>This project will compare and contrast the predictions of various continuum models for flow in substrata of glaciers. A principal aspect of this study will be to investigate the variation of the onset of yield stress and its influence on material system response through generalized Herschel-Bulkley modelling; including shear thinning/thickening behaviour. Alternative modeling approaches shall include viscoplastic (yield stress), viscoelastic and visco-elasto-plastic (yield stress and memory) idealisations. The work will contain a literature review, and introduce front-tracking and slip boundary conditions.</p>

          <p>Description: If the aerospace industry is to achieve its aim in reducing emissions and impact on the environment, the next generation of jet engines will need to burn fuel more efficiently and at higher temperatures. Building engine components capable of operating under such harsh environments is a technological challenge and while nickel based superalloys offer the heat resistance needed, they are difficult to join using conventional welding techniques. Rolls Royce are tackling this problem by applying inertia welding techniques to the production of compressor drums, turbine discs and shafts for jet engines. Inertia welding uses the heat generated by friction to fuse metal components together. A work piece is spun at high speed on a flywheel and brought into contact with a stationary component. Within seconds, the pieces reach forging temperature at the point of contact and are bonded together without melting or the addition of liquid metal. Rolls Royce are developing a model to simulate this process in the rotor disc alloy, RR1000 in order to optimize the welding process both in terms of structural integrity and to predict/ minimize residual stresses. In order for the model to make accurate predictions, mechanical property data is required as an input, in particular flow stress information obtained from forging tests. The project will involve data analysis for a range of temperatures and strain rates and the development of a curve fitting/ interpolation program. This program should be able to predict the flow stress for a given temperature and strain rate. Ideally the fitting routine should utilise a phenomenological deformation model. Material characterization will also form part of the analysis in order to define failure mechanisms and material stability within the defined test parameters.</p>

          <p>Description: The latest generation of nickel based superalloys must offer improved temperature capabilty to aero-engine and land based energy turbine manufacturers in order to improve plant effeciency and meet increasingly stringent envronmental regulations. Due to the combination of alloy metallurgy and extreme operational conditions, such alloys are prone to high temperature oxidation and sulphidation damage that can potentially compromise subsequent mechanical performance.</p>
            
            <p>This short project will characterise surface damage incurred during normal service operation in turbine disc components supplied by Rolls-Royce. As operating conditions (especially temperature) are pushed beyond previously defined design limits, instances of high temperature corrosion are becoming more regular. However, to date the scientific understanding of such damage remains extremely limited. An assessment of ex-service parts is now considered essential since fatigue cracks could initiate from sites of surface corrosion, acting as localised stress raising features (e.g. oxidised grain boundaries and surface inclusions, sulphidation pitting etc). Thus, the project will have direct engineering implications together with academic interest. The project objectives can be summarised as:</p>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Detect instances of surface oxidation / sulphidation in ex-service turbine components</li>
            
            <li>Characterise typical forms of high temperature corrosion damage</li>
            
            <li>Create an imaging database to archive instances of such damage</li>
            
            <li>Define physical corrosion metrics (corroded area, pit depths etc)</li>
            
            <li>Consider the potential implications for mechanical performance (fatigue and creep)</li>

          <p>Industry in general is faced with substantial challenges in the field of structural metals if it is to secure future sustainable growth. In order to meet demanding performance and environmental targets a considerable drive to improve upon conventional metallic alloys will be necessary. It is widely considered that improvements to traditional materials via composition optimization alone have been exhausted , therefore, future engineering designs are likely to incorporate innovative processing techniques and â€˜hybridâ€™ components employing dissimilar combinations of two or more alloy variants. Key to achieving this will be the development of novel joining technologies. The capability to join a metal to itself or to a different alloy greatly increases flexibility in design, production and repair when compared with traditional processing routes such as casting or forging and consequently, a wide variety of different joining techniques have been developed. Solid state welding techniques, such as linear friction welding are receiving considerable interest within the aerospace industry in the joining of advanced alloy systems, where these alloys are only joinable via such friction weld based processes</p>
            
            <p>This project will underpin the development of friction welding methods and process models for friction welding of titanium, nickel and steel alloys. The work will develop and understand a small scale disc bend test method, in order to characterize the mechanical properties of development linear friction welds. Carry out a range of tests to build up a database of results to ensure validity of the method and its relevant equations. The technique will be particularly effective when looking into weld simulations on Ï†10mm cylindrical rods, where the heat/cool treated zone is of a small thickness. Exploration of different heat profiles with the aim to establish effects on microstructure, properties and in turn optimising the process.</p>
