          <p>This project will compare and contrast the predictions of various continuum models for flow in substrata of glaciers. A principal aspect of this study will be to investigate the variation of the onset of yield stress and its influence on material system response through generalized Herschel-Bulkley modelling; including shear thinning/thickening behaviour. Alternative modeling approaches shall include viscoplastic (yield stress), viscoelastic and visco-elasto-plastic (yield stress and memory) idealisations. The work will contain a literature review, and introduce front-tracking and slip boundary conditions.</p>

          <p>Trusses are widely used in aerospace, mechanical and civil engineering. Optimal design of these trusses can be done using performance criteria, such as stiffness, strength and weight. Although these are valid criteria, cost is becoming an increasingly important factor. Some of the cost is linearly linked to the weight of the structure. Other cost factors are more difficult to quantify. The aim of this project is to develop a cost model for trusses with an emphasis on manufacturing cost, and here by concentrating on the cost of manufacture of joints. The overall cost model is to be implemented in Matlab so that it can be used in in-house truss optimization programmes.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Most problems in structural optimization must be formulated as constrained problems. In a typical structural design problem the objective function is a fairly simple function of the design variables (e.g., weight), but the design has to satisfy a host of stress, displacement, buckling, and frequency constraints. These constraints are usually complex functions of the design variables available only from an analysis of a ﬁnite element model of the structure.
            The objective of this work is to explore the features of the Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser function and investigate the usability of this special function in optimization. The project will involve extensive programming in Matlab.</p>

          <p>A typical aircraft is full of sensors and measurement devices that record every aspect of a flight every second. Sometimes this data is monitored live by engine manufacturers. The main objective is to discover abnormal behaviour of systems even though its occurrence is very rare.</p>
            
            <p>This project will review challenges in data measurement and capture along with time series models that are used to make sense from this data. The student also has an opportunity to develop some of the simple models in MATLAB to enhance his/her understanding in this subject. The technical skills developed in this project are generic and can be applied to number of other fields.</p>
