        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The Head of Teaching is keen to exploit technology to improve the range and scope of experiences available to students in Engineering. One of his ideas is to develop a library of examples in Matlab and/or Mathematica that can be used to demonstrate important engineering principles in lectures and could serve as tutorial problems. Mechanical engineering is already a subject that is well served by such examples. The aim of this project would be survey the examples already available from the Mathworks and Wolfram and, with the help of lecture staff, identify new topics that can be illustrated in similar ways. It is expected that the student will also develop some demonstrations as well. Some example topics are signals and systems theory, control systems, statics and dynamics and system modelling and simulation. An important requirement will be the exploitation of the user interface features provided by Matlab and/or Mathematica to create easy to use and compelling simulations. The resulting library will need to be well documented, usable by both staff and students, and easy to extend in the future. Examples that can be delivered on mobile devices such as smart phones or table PCs will be of particular interest. As inspiration for these see the Mobile and Tablet Apps page at Wolfram|Alpha http://products.wolframalpha.com/mobile/.</p>

          <p>The cars control systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated. The traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) is expected to significantly increase the road safety. This project will design such a TCAS system to be used in pre-defined environments such as on motorways or in the urban streets. The key step in designing TCAS systems is to predict the cars movements and share such information among the nearby cars. This information is then evaluted by TCAS systems in the cars in order to decide whether the collision is imminent, and if yes, some corrective action to avoid the collision is suggested to the driver, or, possibly, the car actuator systems may even automatically initiate the collision avoiding corrective action.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Tube hydro forming has already proved successful in sub frame and chassis applications. Due to the fact that standard tube making methods are restricted to production of tubes with a diameter to thickness ratio of 65:1, when 100:1 is required, there has been limited uptake of this technology. However, the Corus tubular blank process allows a greater diameter to thickness ratio and so has more potential for wide spread use in Chassis applications. The major technical issue concerned with the manufacture of Corus tubular blanks is the effect of material elastic recovery (measured through springback) after forming has taken place.</p>
            
            <p>This project will develop a Fuzzy Neural Network model (the so called ANFIS architecture) for springback prediction and in the process identify the important design and process variables associated with springback.  The predictions from the model will then be compared to those obtained using existing predictive models. Finally, The finished Fuzzy Neural Network will be used to find settings for the process variables that help minimise elastic recovery.</p>

          <p>The use of bladed discs has the potential to eliminate complex aerofoil attachment arrangements that can result in a substantial reduction in weight. For this project you will be presented with the results from a systematic study of the effect of process variables on the mechanical properties of friction welded Ti-64 aero engine blades. The objective of the project will then be to build a Fuzzy Neural Network model (the so called ANFIS architecture) model of this friction welding process. This will be compared to the results obtained using a response surface methodology. From these models you will seek those manufacturing conditions that maximise the degree of upset in the finished welds and minimise the variability in upset around this maximum.</p>

          <p>Geometrically-necessary dislocation (GND) content can be determined by the effect of dislocations on the lattice curvature of a crystal. Local orientations are measured using Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), which are then used to determine the local orientation gradients and resolved into the GND content. There is experimental evidence that GND content accumulates at grain boundaries during plastic deformation, the magnitude of which may be related to the geometry of the grain boundary. The objective of this project will be to determine any relationship between the GND content accumulated at a grain boundary and the grain boundary character in strained and annealed samples of copper. The student will use orientation data obtained using EBSD to create maps of GND content in the sample. The student will then use image analysis software to obtain plots of GND content as a function of distance from the boundary. Once a sufficient number of boundaries are measured in this manner, the data will be compiled according to the boundary geometry and character as well as the amount of induced strain. This project is also suitable for Materials or Mechanical students.</p>

          <p>As everyone knows "Laser is a solution looking for a problem". This project aims to generate a first report of Laser for Manufacturing in Wales.
            The student should contact industry, industrial body and forum (like Welsh Optoelectronic Forum) and evaluate the today use of Laser in Wales and see future opportunities.
            The studend would need to learn about basic lasers issues and basic laser type for manufacturing.
            The outcome would be a first report that would help to disseminate Laser in Wales and open several employment opportunities.
            Good writing skills are required as well as the ability of organize the large amoount of different output received.</p>

          <p>In the production of new alloys for engineering applications at high temperature, creep lifing is extremely important. Premature failures can have catastrophic consequences that under some circumstances can involve expensive application shut downs, or even potentially loss of life. As such, a number of predictive techniques can be applied to predict long term creep lives based only on short term data, thus saving on protracted and expensive testing programmes. The current project seeks to evaluate these methods for modern power plant steels, including the most up to date revisions made to the recently devised ‘Wilshire equations’.</p>

          <p>Al-alloys are increasingly being used to replace steel in many structural applications due to their good corrosion performance and better specific strength. The use of Al-alloys is expected to increase significantly in automotive applications to reduce vehicle weight, fuel consumption, and CO2 emission. Throughout the UK and EU, Al-alloys are being used to completely replace galvanised-steel street and motorway lighting columns. Welding is used as the most common joining method for Al-parts. However, the heat-affected region created due to welding may render some of these joints susceptible to failure in demanding applications where high stress and environment factors play a decisive role. This is more critical in heat treatable high strength alloys where the strength loss due to welding may be prevalent in the heat affected zones and failure may occur due to stress, corrosion or a combination of both. The aim of the project is to investigate the structure, property and corrosion behaviour of welded joints from heat treatable aluminium-alloys. The effect of designed thermal treatments on improving the joint properties will be explored if time permits.</p>

          <p>Magnesium is the lightest of all structural material and a promising candidate for aerospace, automotive and other structural applications due to their high specific strength and stiffness, good damping properties, good electromagnetic shielding and ease of machining. Advanced Mg-alloys are now being used in helicopters and it is anticipated that proper alloy and process development will significantly increase the use of Mg-alloys in cars. Magnesium car can very effectively address the necessary fuel and emission reduction as required by the ever stringent environment legislations. Drawback of magnesium alloys are low absolute strength, poor corrosion performance and manufacturing cost too prohibitive for mass application in the automotive industry. Many alloys have been developed with improved corrosion property and can be manufactured cost effectively through high-speed die casting. However, majority of the cast alloys are not designed to be heat treated to improve strength, and show poor mechanical property following processing. A new and promising development to address the shortcoming of Mg processing is the development of semisolid processing routes that promise to significantly improve and refine the cast structure, eliminate defects and improve mechanical property of the components processed in near-net shape. Such development can significantly reduce the cost of processing and mechanical performance of Mg-components by combining elements from casting and solid state processing together.
            In the present work, a systematic study will be undertaken to investigate and compare the structure and property of advanced magnesium alloy processed through conventional HPDC and semisolid HPDC. Based on the results the relative strengths and shortcomings of the new technology will be evaluated.</p>

          <p>A large percentage of steel is used in the construction industry and increasingly in the pre-painted form in structures such as the Millennium stadium in Cardiff, Supermarkets, DIY stores and large warehouses. Here the paint is applied by the steel maker and simply assembled onsite. These materials have long warranty periods of up to 40 years and failure generally occurs at the cut-edge of the material where metal is exposed and may corrode allowing the paint to peel off. To combat cut-edge corrosion the steels are coated with a zinc alloy and additions of corrosion inhibitors are made to the paint layers to retard corrosion. These inhibitors are critical and have traditionally been based on chromate systems. However, the chromium (VI) ions are carcinogenic and the use of such materials is being reduced through stringent legislation. Thus, steel companies are driven to find effective Chromate free systems that offer comparable corrosion resistance. This project will encompass a detailed literature survey of the current advances in chrome free technologies involving novel systems such as titanates, phosphates, ion exchange systems etc. to enable Tata steel to develop the coatings of the future.</p>

          <p>Zn-Al-Mg alloys potentially offer substantially increased corrosion protection for steels used in a variety of applications from advanced car bodies to construction. The microstructure of the alloy is critical in determining the mechanical and corrosion properties of the materials. Additional elements such as Titanium and Germanium maybe added to the alloys in small quantities to vastly alter the microstructures and potentially their physical and chemical properties. This project will involve a detailed literature search of the current thinking behind grain refinement and also potentially mechanical tests of modified alloys.  This work is industrially linked to Tata Steel and the student will work closely with both academics and industrialists in this critical work. The experimental work in the project will take place in Swansea University and also the new state of the art £20 million SPECIFIC research facility in the Baglan Innovation centre, Baglan Bay and thus the student must be willing to travel to this facility. The centre has brand new, state of the art experimentation apparatus and thus provides an excellent research environment and a great opportunity to interface directly with industrial research.</p>

          <p>This project will develop novel production technology for low-cost Concentrator PV (CPV) using reclaimed silicon wafers from the semiconductor industry with low-cost concentrator lenses.</p>
            
            <p>Low-cost photovoltaics (PV) will be the major sustainable, clean energy solution for future energy demands. Silicon dominates PV technology (80% PV market share) and PV technology roadmaps predict that silicon cells will continue to be the primary source of solar power.</p>
            
            <p>Following the new government Feed-in Tariff (FIT) scheme, introduced to promote uptake of renewable electricity generation technologies, the demand for solar power is booming.</p>
            
            <p>Standard silicon cells have good efficiencies but require high energy inputs during manufacturing. Silicon wafers, reclaimed from the semiconductor industry (ideal for PV cells), do not require any thermal processing. Recycled wafers thus represent the greenest possible silicon PV option with energy payback times reduced by more than 5 times. Innovative large area (250 mm sq.) cells from reclaimed wafers will be integrated with novel low-cost Concentrating Photovoltaic (CPV) modules operating at 10 to 20 suns (20 times normal sun intensity). This could yield up to 20 times more power than a standard PV module. The static module will use a novel sunlight trapping and focusing to maximise cell light capture and will avoid costly tracking and cooling systems. These modules could be used as remote off-grid power generation sources or for grid connected power.</p>
            
            <p>This project will develop new R&amp;D technology for sustainable energy generation in collaboration with advanced manufacturing companies in the local area.</p>

          Description
        </h3>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Finite element stress analysis is an extremely powerful computation method for predicting displacements, stresses and strains in components and structures subject to tension, compression, bending, torsion, shear and pressure and, in many cases, combinations of two or more of these fundamental loading types.</p>
            
            <p>It is an approximate method and so the accuracy of the predictions depends, to a great extent, on the model. Stress concentrations can be produced by real effects such as holes, fillets etc. or unrealistic effects such as point loads. In the latter case, the predictions can be highly unrealistic and methods to take account of these high predicted stresses have been proposed.</p>
            
            <p>This numerical project will involve looking at a number of stress concentration features, using finite element analysis, and assessing the suitability of the proposed methods in ‘smoothing out’ the localised high stresses so that the predictions are more realistic.</p>

          <p>The aim of this project is to investigate the mechanical properties of ZnO nanostructures using atomic force microscopy. ZnO nanoparticles are  currently used in the paints and cosmetics industry. Novel ZnO nanostructures such as nanowires have many potential applications and are ideal building blocks for nanoscale devices. Because of their small size, they have novel and exciting properties that can be harnessed into these nano-devices, with potential applications in many areas such as gas sensing, bio-sensing, nanomedicine, electronics and optoelectronics.
            During this project, the student will use an Atomic force microscope to probe the mechanical response of vertical arrays of ZnO nanowires, using the AFM cantilever to load the nanowires with nano newton forces and measure their stiffness.</p>

          <p>This computational project looks at the physics of long chain polymer molecules. An individual polymer molecule can exhibit conformations ranging from a densely packed globule to a highly extended structure. This project will use numerical methods to simulate polymer conformations and hence calculate the probability distribution function P(R,N) of an isolated polymer chain in solution (P(R,N)= the probability that a polymer of degree of polymerisation N has an end-to-end vector of magnitude R). The project will then look at either i) the effect of polymer-solvent interactions on conformation or ii)  simulations of dynamics using either Monte Carlo of molecular dynamics techniques.</p>

          <p>Phase separation in binary liquid mixtures occurs when an initially homogeneous system breaks up into two co-existing phases.

This computational project will use finite-difference methods to simulate the time development  of the phase-separating morphology both in liquid mixtures in one dimension (see Ball &amp; Essery J.

          <p>Conjugated polymers are relatively new materials that consist of alternating double &amp; single carbon-carbon bonds along the backbone of the polymer. This structure leads to the delocalisation of electrons along the polymer backbone. This delocalisation enables electrical conduction to occur within a single polymer molecule and gives rise to the semiconducting &amp; light-emitting properties exhibited by many different conjugated polymers. However, it also greatly increases the stiffness of the polymer chains and is expected to influence the flow behaviour of the polymers when molten.</p>
            
            <p>This project involves an extensive literature survey on the flow properties of both molten conjugated polymers and conjugated polymers in solution.

          <p>Car manufacturers are increasingly using composite materials in an effort to reduce vehicle weight in order to improve fuel economy, CO2 emissions and the carbon footprint. Typically, structural composites have used synthetic reinforcements such as glass and carbon fibres or low cost fillers such as talc. In recent years, the use of natural fibres as a reinforcement has also gained applications as a lightweight and sustainable resource. Additionally, newly developed nanocomposites are starting to make inroads into the vehicle market. However, at the same time, legislation is forcing manufacturers to recycle all end-of-life vehicles, and composite materials in general are more difficult to recycle.
            This project should aim to review current usage of composites in vehicles including specific case studies and assessment of likely future trends. In addition to the technical aspects, the project might also consider the effects of environmental concerns and legislation.</p>

          <p>Large quantities of waste glass are currently generated in this country and a variety of applications are being sought. One potential low carbon application is using recycled glass as a heat sink and subsequently as a slow release heat source. It is believed that broken or imploded glass contained in a vessel could act to help stabilise temperatures in contained environments such as green houses and conservatories. It is felt that there could be potential in manufacturing and marketing this as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional heating mechanisms. The aim of the project is to assess the potential for such heat exchange mechanisms to provide small amounts of heating and cooling in contained environments.
            The project could address some of the following issues:
            • Heat uptake/release of different types/sizes/arrangements/colours of glass.
            • Effects of combining glass with different solid and/or liquid materials on heat uptake, retention and release properties.
            • The potential for heat exchange to warm airflows within contained environments.
            • Comparison of different system designs.
            • Practicalities of setting-up and designing an appropriate system.</p>

          <p>Composites are increasingly being used in structural applications where designers take advantage of their strength and stiffness combined with low density. These properties lend themselves to transport applications, such as the aerospace and automotive industries, where impact damage can be a problem. Another issue with polymer based composites is that they are subject to stress relaxation, that is, if held at a constant strain, the stress reduces with time. In this project it is planned to carry out an investigation into combined effects of impact and stress relaxation by damaging composite samples and then testing their subsequent mechanical properties. It is also hoped that from the results a model can be produced to describe the stress relaxation behaviour.</p>

          <p>All current spacecraft use chemical rockets for launch, though some have used air-breathing engines on their first stage. Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters for orbital station-keeping and some use momentum wheels for attitude control. Soviet bloc satellites have used electric propulsion for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north-south stationkeeping. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have experimentally used ion thrusters (a form of electric propulsion) to great success. The aim of this project is to investigate likely future developments in rocket (spacecraft) propulsion which will increase efficiency and hence the feasibility of projects such as manned interplanetary travel</p>

          <p>This project proposes the response surface method for finite element model updating. The response surface method is implemented by approximating the finite element model surface response equation by adaptive high dimensional model representation (HDMR). The updated parameters of the finite element model were calculated using genetic algorithm by optimizing the surface response equation. The proposed method will then be compared with the existing methods that use simulated annealing or genetic algorithm together with a full finite element model for finite element model updating. The proposed method will be tested on an aircraft wing structure. It is anticipated that the proposed method will provide the updated natural frequencies and mode shapes that were of the same order of accuracy as those given by simulated annealing and genetic algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed approach would provide an efficient computational tool compared with the genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing.</p>

          <p>A drug delivery system consisting of a micro-pump, drug reservoir, microfluidics channels and an array of hollow microneedles will be developed. The project objective is to investigate the viability of onstant real-time feedback from a sensor to a drug delivery device.
            This integrated system will enable frequent and regular injection of the therapeutic agent via transdermal microneedles to achieve the optimum therapeutic dose for the patient.
            The microfluidics and microneedles will be fabricated using new CNH deep-etch and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) tools. The new CNH fabrication facilities have been targeted specifically for this type of research and the project would be one of the first to utilise the photolithography, EBL, etch &amp; deposition, surface and electrical characterisation tools at the CNH. The timing of the PhD studentships will coincide with the installation of the new £600k equipment and the studentships will be an ideal way to generate early momentum and ensure that the facilities have dedicated users who are trained by the equipment manufacturers and will generate immediate outputs for CNH.
            The studentship would also coincides with the EPSRC Grand Challenge in Nanohealth, which would directly allocate substantial funds for materials, consumables, investigator time and running costs for the project. Manpower for the development of the microfluidics/microneedles systems is essential in order to achieve the Grand Challenge objectives.
            This project has massive scope for collaboration with industry and integrated research technologies. For instance, the integrated biosensor / microfluidics system will eventually be used in a portable, hand-held, real-time diagnosis or monitoring system.
            This is a multidisciplinary Nanohealth project.</p>

          <p>The student should review the use of laser to cut steel in Automotive, Aeronautic and Naval industry.</p>
            
            <p>Laser is now available for cutting and welding large plates and is becoming the only tool to cut new generation of steels.
            Laser performance and steel development are therefore strictly related.
            New steels aim stronger and lighter components improving carbon emission footprint.
            The project should aim to define the state of the art of Laser cutting/welding and foresee the near future. This is a critical issue for the UK manufacturing industry.
            Student should find out information trough literature research as well as by contacting major European Steel and Laser companies.
            An understanding of material properties (interaction with light, cutting welding) and Matlab skills are essential.</p>
