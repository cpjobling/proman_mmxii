          <p>Location Based Services (LBS) and the associated technologies are fundamental to many of the mobiles services that we enjoy today in our daily life. We are developing a framework for location based services on the University campus. There are a number of strands of work that you could involve in from design of a location based service or analysis of location data. The student will join an existing research group working to develop various aspects of location based technologies and services and this project will supplement to the existing research being carried out by the group. You are expected to have fairly good skills and interest in ICT technologies, programming and simulations.</p>
