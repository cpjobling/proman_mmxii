        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Various types of physiological signals can be collected to determine the human object functioning and performance. Such measurements are often distorted by measurement noises which negatively affects interpretation and evaluation of these signals. In this project, the student will consider digital signal pre-processing techniques that can be used to suppress the measurement noises for a selected class of physiological signals. The noise suppression pre-processing would be then normally followed by feature extraction and classification algorithms to test various hypothesis about the human object under consideration. These post-processing algorithms can be also considered in the project depending on the student's interest.</p>

          <p>Soccer kick: boot mass</p>
            
            <p>A simple model of kicking suggests that a heavier boot should produce a greater ball velocity. The student will use 100 Hz 2-D video to measure kicking with soccer boot and with attached masses of 200g, 400g, 600g and 800g. However, the ball velocity tends to remain constant because the extra mass produces a counteracting decrease in foot velocity. The student may need to look at the kicking mechanics to identify the mechanism for the decrease in foot velocity.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Over the last 12 months the Welsh team has competed against many of the best teams in the world and lost. Whilst this is not necessarily a bad achievement the fact that in many of these matches the Welsh team had chances to achieve better results and let them slip is of slight concern. A more worrying trend is the performances against the weaker teams such as Italy and Fiji. These are teams that should have been easily beaten given the abilities shown against New Zealand and South Africa. In all matches the Welsh team seem to have a lack of belief in their ability to win the match and performed at a level that was close to that of the opposition. This is in stark contrast to the recent grand slam team which seemed to have a belief that far outstripped the team’s overall skill set.</p>
            
            <p>The underlying question of this project is how do you change the mindset of a team, rather than an individual, in order to stop them underperforming? As a sceptic about the ability of an external factor being able to affect a team’s performance can you scientifically demonstrate the benefit of your ideas to me?</p>

          <p>Nanotechnology is being applied to many areas of sport, especially in the finding of novel materials to obtain better sport equipment performances. Carbon nanotubes have been incorporated in sport equipments for the past few years, particularly by companies such as Yonex, makers of badminton racquets. The remarkable mechanical properties exhibited by carbon nanotubes have simulated much interest in their use to reinforce advanced composites. Their elastic modules is over 1TPa and tensile strength is over 150 GPa which makes them many times stiffer and stronger than steel while being three to five times lighter. In promoting their products, several manufacturers of sports equipment have advertised carbon nanotubes as reinforcement of some of their top of the line products. The student will carry out literature review in this specific topic and investigate the different challenges of using carbon nanotubes in sports equipment development and manufacturing, and also what needs to be overcome before the carbon nanotubes can be widely used.</p>

          <p>Current recommendations encourage athletes to drink at a rate that will prevent excessive dehydration (>2% body mass) during exercise.  Therefore, although individual drinking practices vary, most will finish a bout of exercise in a hypohydrated state.  If repeated exercise sessions are scheduled on the same day or the fluid deficit is large, some athletes may fail to re-establish fluid balance and consequently this may, in some situations, be detrimental to performance.</p>
            
            <p>Post-exercise rehydration has been the focus of a number of studies.  These previous investigations have typically focussed on the electrolyte (eg. sodium and potassium) content and volume of fluid consumed, but several recent studies have investigated the effects of carbohydrate.
            Drawing on some new and exciting research that has re-shaped our understanding of carbohydrate ingestion during exercise, this project will investigate the effect of different carbohydrate drinks on fluid and electrolyte balance following exercise in an attempt to determine if they could enhance the recovery process.</p>

          <p>Bicycles have evolved tremendously not only as a means of transportation but also in recreational and sports areas. Today there are bicycles catering for different purpose from street bikes to mountain bikes or sprint bikes used in sports. Naturally, the choices of materials have tremendously evolved for different types of bicycles to tailor the specific properties necessary to fulfill the desired application. In the present research a systematic investigation will be conducted to study the evolution of bicycle frames in terms of materials used. The progressive application of different types of materials of choice for different types of bikes will be documented. A comparison between different traditional and advanced materials will be performed through software analysis to identify their property and suitability for the specific application. Finally, potential applications of advanced materials currently being developed will be explored.</p>

          <p>The practice of monitoring respiratory function during exercise is now well established as a training aid in sports science. Spirometry can be used to measure lung capacity, while measurement of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in inhaled/exhaled breath allows calculation of parameters such as peak oxygen uptake (VO2). However, there is increasing interest in monitoring other gases in human exhalations as a means of tracking sporting performance. For example, there is evidence to suggest that certain food supplements or types of diet aimed at sportspeople can lead to heightened levels of atypical species, such as nitric acid or aldehydes in exhaled breath. This project aims to review key developments in the field of in-line breath monitoring applied to sports science. There may also be scope to utilize a newly acquired nitric oxide breath analyser for a preliminary assessment of the exhalation of human subjects both prior to and following consumption of dietary supplements aimed at improved sports performance.</p>

The aim of this project is to establish how competition times have changed with use of different suit designs. Quite a lot of this work will involve data gathering and analysis, for instance an analysis of competition times over recent years and correlation with the introduction of different materials. There may be some scope for some in-pool trials though this depends on availability of volunteers with different suits.</p>

          <p>In 2012 the UK will host the Olympics. It is likely that some athletes will use drugs to enhance their performance. Identifying athletes who take anabolic steroids to enhance their performance is problematic for analytical chemists. In recent years, advances in analytical equipment have enabled measurement of these substances. From this, the natural or synthetic origin of the steroid can be deduced, conclusively proving whether cheating has taken place.</p>
            
            <p>This project aims to critically analyse the recent literature findings on the recent analytical techniques used to detect steroids used by athletes, and in what ways steroid drug cheats are fighting back in order to prevent detection.</p>

          <p>Central blood pressure is a more accurate indicator of the blood pressure (BP) developed by the heart, peripheral BP measurement being a relatively poor surrogate of this value. Central BP can be estimated non-invasively from arm cuff BP using the pulse wave ‘augmentation index’ (AI). This study will use a newly developed device (the MobilOGraph) to assess the central BP and AI responses to physical exercise in healthy males and females.</p>

Why do some clubs/countries excel at penalty shootouts, whilst others struggle?

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Current recommendations encourage athletes to drink at a rate that will prevent excessive dehydration (>2% body mass) during exercise.  Therefore, although individual drinking practices vary, most will finish a bout of exercise in a hypohydrated state.  If repeated exercise sessions are scheduled on the same day or the fluid deficit is large, some athletes may fail to re-establish fluid balance and consequently this may, in some situations, be detrimental to performance.</p>
            
            <p>Post-exercise rehydration has been the focus of a number of studies.  These previous investigations have typically focussed on the electrolyte (eg. sodium and potassium) content and volume of fluid consumed, but some have used caffeinated drinks.</p>
            
            <p>Some authors suggest that the diuretic effect of caffeine may be reduced following exercise, although this view is not shared by all.  However, the drinks used in these investigations were commercially available and differed in several respects which limit the conclusions that can be drawn from these studies.</p>
            
            <p>This project will systematically investigate the effect of different doses of caffeine on fluid and electrolyte balance following exercise in an attempt to determine if caffeine could enhance or be detrimental to the recovery process.</p>
            
            <p>This project will be laboratory based, will be hands-on in terms of data collection and may involve some long days.</p>

          <p>The student will research the development of chemical performance enhancement (doping) in competitive sport. They will be expected to produce a reasoned analysis of which physiological systems are influenced by different classes of dopant and the mechanisms by which performance is enhanced. They will also be expected to describe the parallel development of detection methodologies aimed at controlling or eliminating doping in sport. An account should be given of how doping detection has been (and still is in some cases) circumvented by using intelligent dosing regimes and substances naturally occurring in the human body. Finally, a reasoned prediction should be given as to likely future developments in doping and doping detection.</p>

          <p>In order to understand a player’s behaviour in a sport game, it would be essential to track player’s movement and analyze it. This requires positioning techniques for players. While there are various approaches and techniques for positioning, there are different and strict requirement for player’s positioning. As players should not have any impact on their performance from signalling devices that allow movement tracking, the weight of signalling devices should be light. This creates a number of challenging issues. In this project, the review of existing positioning techniques should be carried out first. Among existing techniques, a few candidates should be selected according to the requirements. Computer simulations should be built to understand their limitations and effectiveness in tracking player’s movement.</p>
