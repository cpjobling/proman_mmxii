          <p>In ophthalmology, high intraocular pressure (IOP) inside the eye is considered to be a key indicator for glaucoma – a treatable condition which is the second most common cause of irreversible blindness in the world.</p>
            
            <p>Of the various techniques available, Goldmann Applanation Tonometry is considered to be the “gold standard” procedure for the determination of IOP. The technique requires the application of a disinfected prism mounted on a pressure sensitive probe onto the cornea of a patient’s eye. The testing apparatus then measures the corneal structural resistance to an applied pressure.</p>
            
            <p>The logic of the test is that high IOP will result in a higher pressure being required for a given displacement. However, factors such as natural variation in corneal thickness, corneal curvature and corneal material properties - which can all have a direct bearing on the corneal structural resistance - can affect the IOP measurement and could therefore lead to misdiagnososis of glaucoma.</p>
            
            <p>This project will use nonlinear finite element computational modelling to assess the possible impact of corneal thickness and corneal curvature on the measured IOP.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Nanoparticles are now being widely used in the development of novel medical diagnostic and therapeutic applications; these promise to detect cancer through the imaging of magnetic or fluorescent particles or to treat disease in a targeted manner to individual, diseased cells through nano-delivery vehicles for drugs. All of this is made possible by a natural cellular process - endocytosis, which is the primary route through which cells take up small particles and large molecules from their environment. This process has evolved to be most efficient for particles in the size range of 10-100 nm and so provides an intrinsic delivery route for nanomedicine. However, whilst much observation of nanoparticle uptake through endocytosis has been done there is still no clear understanding of the detailed processes at play and this limits our ability to predict the likely nanoparticle dose. In this project students will work alongside PhD students who are looking at data analysis of nanoparticle uptake into individual cells and developing computational models of the endocytic process.</p>
