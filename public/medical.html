            <p>Of the various techniques available, Goldmann Applanation Tonometry is considered to be the “gold standard” procedure for the determination of IOP.

            <p>The logic of the test is that high IOP will result in a higher pressure being required for a given displacement. However, factors such as natural variation in corneal thickness, corneal curvature and corneal material properties - which can all have a direct bearing on the corneal structural resistance - can affect the IOP measurement and could therefore lead to misdiagnososis of glaucoma.</p>

          <p>Computer models enable us to study the physiology of the lymphatic system in health and disease. Hence, in this project a time-dependent flow model (ODE) will be developed of the lymphatic system. This network consists of a set of self-contracting flexible tubes with valves in order to propel the fluid from the interstitial spaces of the tissues to the blood stream. After a literature review the student will develop the network model in matlab and investigate the physiology of 1 or more lymphangions.</p>

          <p>This project will use the JuLi automated image capture system to observe growing and dividing cancer cells over periods of hours to days. This experimental platform provides automated image capture of cells whilst in an incubator and so allows us to study the dynamic processes involved in tumour cell growth and proliferation. Following image capture the students will be involved in image analysis using fluorescent nanoparticles as point sources within the cells to follow motion and division. The biological questions to be addressed are:</p>
            
            <ol>
            <li>What is the variability in cell growth rate?</li>
            
            <li>Are there marked asymmetries in daughter cell form or function which suggest ‘differentiation’ of the cancer cell in a process akin to stem cell development?</li>
            
            <li>Can family trees of cancer cell lineage be constructed from this experimental data?</li>
            </ol>

          <p>A newly launched initiative between the colleges of medicine and engineering is looking at the effect of nanoparticles on the human immune system. There are two important reasons for undertaking such a study: i. the increasing use of nanotechnology is raising many questions as to the safety of nanoscale particles and ii. many new medical diagnostic and treatment methods are based on the use of nanoparticles. In this project students will work alongside PhD and postdoctoral researchers looking at the effects of nanoparticles on the human immune system. Fluorescent, polymeric nanobeads will be used with primary blood samples from blood donors. Very little is known about the uptake of nanoparticles into white blood cells or of the influence of age, gender, health status on this. Using flow cytometry the project will quantify the dose of nanoparticles present in each of the important blood cell sub-groups – T-Cells, mononuclear cells, granulocytes and assess the degree of immune response triggered by the nanoparticles by studying cell signalling molecules. Detailed analysis of the data using statistical techniques will provide an insight to the cell-to-cell variability in nanoparticle uptake, the degree of correlation of dose with immune response and the links between cell-level biology and the whole person response.</p>

          <p>Nanoparticles are now being widely used in the development of novel medical diagnostic and therapeutic applications; these promise to detect cancer through the imaging of magnetic or fluorescent particles or to treat disease in a targeted manner to individual, diseased cells through nano-delivery vehicles for drugs. All of this is made possible by a natural cellular process - endocytosis, which is the primary route through which cells take up small particles and large molecules from their environment. This process has evolved to be most efficient for particles in the size range of 10-100 nm and so provides an intrinsic delivery route for nanomedicine. However, whilst much observation of nanoparticle uptake through endocytosis has been done there is still no clear understanding of the detailed processes at play and this limits our ability to predict the likely nanoparticle dose. In this project students will work alongside PhD students who are looking at data analysis of nanoparticle uptake into individual cells and developing computational models of the endocytic process.</p>

          <p>This project is part of our wider collaboration with colleagues at the Bristol Heart Institute working on stem cell therapies for heart disease. At Swansea we are using novel, image-based cytometry to visualise many thousands of blood cells from bone marrow extraction and so detect the small fractions of stem cells present. This is part of a strategy to improve our understanding and identification of stem cells in order to direct the differentiation process that drives regeneration and hence thearapeutic results. The student will be involved in the image analysis and corresponding development of mathematical models of stem cell biology at Swansea; they will also interact with the Bristol team and have the opportunity to see first-hand the work at Bristol in the medical application of stem cell technologies.</p>

          <p>The project will explore rheometric approaches to the characterization of the linear stress relaxation modulus of biopolymer gel systems under a range of setting (‘quench’) temperatures using two principal experimental techniques. The first of these employs a true fixed strain test in a controlled displacement type instrument under which condition the shear stress is continuously monitored following the sudden imposition of an initial deformation within the linear regime. The second employs a similar approach implemented on a controlled stress instrument under pseudo controlled strain conditions. The project will seek to assess and optimize the ranges of validity of test parameters under which complementary results can be accurately obtained from both tests.</p>

          <p>In collaboration with a local medical device company this project will test methods used to assess the coating of medical implant devices. The surface of a medical implant is the interface between the device and the human body, how the surfaces interact governs the efficiency of the devices operation. If the device operation involves the passage of an electrical current, the device must have an insulating coating. If the coating breaks down then the current leaks to the surrounding tissue, causing pain during the operating procedure. Thus we have established an experimental rig within the laboratories at Swansea which localises dye at the point where an insulating coating has been compromised. The student will survey the use of the implants and then improve the design of the experimental rig, followed by testing based on undamaged and damaged medical devices.</p>

          <p>A major problem for many medical implant devices is the formation of biofilms at the surface of the implant leading to a high degree of patient morbidity and mortality. When a medical implant is placed in the body it acts as a very attractive surface for bacteria to adhere to, where they have inproved survival and go on to form complex biofilms which are able to resist treatment with antibiotics. Thus, methods that control the build up of biofilm are of tremendous interest. The student will use hydrodynamic shear assays to assess the attachment of model mircroorganisms to implant biomaterials. Various techniques to control the biofilm will be explored.</p>
