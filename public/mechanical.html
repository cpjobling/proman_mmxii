          <p>This computational project looks at the physics of long chain polymer molecules. An individual polymer molecule can exhibit conformations ranging from a densely packed globule to a highly extended structure. This project will use numerical methods to simulate polymer conformations and hence calculate the probability distribution function P(R,N) of an isolated polymer chain in solution (P(R,N)= the probability that a polymer of degree of polymerisation N has an end-to-end vector of magnitude R). The project will then look at either i) the effect of polymer-solvent interactions on conformation or ii)  simulations of dynamics using either Monte Carlo of molecular dynamics techniques.</p>

          <p>Phase separation in binary liquid mixtures occurs when an initially homogeneous system breaks up into two co-existing phases. For example, a mixture of two polymers can undergo separation into two phases (each phase being highly concentrated in only one of the two polymers) in response to a change in temperature. This computational project will use finite-difference methods to simulate the time development  of the phase-separating morphology both in liquid mixtures in one dimension (see Ball &amp; Essery J. Phys.; Condens. Matter 2 (1990) 10303).</p>

          <p>Conjugated polymers are relatively new materials that consist of alternating double &amp; single carbon-carbon bonds along the backbone of the polymer. This structure leads to the delocalisation of electrons along the polymer backbone. This delocalisation enables electrical conduction to occur within a single polymer molecule and gives rise to the semiconducting &amp; light-emitting properties exhibited by many different conjugated polymers. However, it also greatly increases the stiffness of the polymer chains and is expected to influence the flow behaviour of the polymers when molten.</p>
            
            <p>This project involves an extensive literature survey on the flow properties of both molten conjugated polymers and conjugated polymers in solution. The focus of the survey should be on i) what are the mechanical flow properties (rheology) of these polymers and how do they differ from other polymeric and liquid-crystalline materials? ii) how can conjugated polymers be applied to substrates to make electronic circuits via printing &amp; patterning techniques? iii) can the mechanical flow properties of conjugated polymers be exploited to improve performance in plastic electronic devices such as diodes and transistors?</p>

          <p>This project proposes the response surface method for finite element model updating. The response surface method is implemented by approximating the finite element model surface response equation by adaptive high dimensional model representation (HDMR). The updated parameters of the finite element model were calculated using genetic algorithm by optimizing the surface response equation. The proposed method will then be compared with the existing methods that use simulated annealing or genetic algorithm together with a full finite element model for finite element model updating. The proposed method will be tested on an aircraft wing structure. It is anticipated that the proposed method will provide the updated natural frequencies and mode shapes that were of the same order of accuracy as those given by simulated annealing and genetic algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed approach would provide an efficient computational tool compared with the genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing.</p>
