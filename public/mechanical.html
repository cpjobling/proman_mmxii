        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>This project proposes the response surface method for finite element model updating. The response surface method is implemented by approximating the finite element model surface response equation by adaptive high dimensional model representation (HDMR). The updated parameters of the finite element model were calculated using genetic algorithm by optimizing the surface response equation. The proposed method will then be compared with the existing methods that use simulated annealing or genetic algorithm together with a full finite element model for finite element model updating. The proposed method will be tested on an aircraft wing structure. It is anticipated that the proposed method will provide the updated natural frequencies and mode shapes that were of the same order of accuracy as those given by simulated annealing and genetic algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed approach would provide an efficient computational tool compared with the genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>This project aims to perform an atomistic simulation of fracture of copper symmetric tilt grain boundary. A parallel molecular dynamics code, LAMMPS, will be used to calculate stresses at the grain boundary as the strain of the bicrystal is incrementally increased. Matlab will be used to plot a stress-strain curve, and Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) will be used to visualize the simulation.</p>
            
            <p>This molecular dynamics simulation calculates the stress-strain relationship of copper symmetric tilt grain boundary under fracture. The grain boundary structure in this case is a &lt;100&gt; Î£5(210) symmetric tilt grain boundary.. The simulation cell is defined such that the bicrystal is pulled in the y-direction, or perpendicular to the boundary interface, to increase strain. The strain in increased for a specified number of times in a loop, and the stress is calculated at each point before the simulation loops.</p>
