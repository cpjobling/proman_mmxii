        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The cars control systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated. The traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) is expected to significantly increase the road safety. This project will design such a TCAS system to be used in pre-defined environments such as on motorways or in the urban streets. The key step in designing TCAS systems is to predict the cars movements and share such information among the nearby cars. This information is then evaluted by TCAS systems in the cars in order to decide whether the collision is imminent, and if yes, some corrective action to avoid the collision is suggested to the driver, or, possibly, the car actuator systems may even automatically initiate the collision avoiding corrective action.</p>

          Description
        </h3>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Tube hydro forming has already proved successful in sub frame and chassis applications. Due to the fact that standard tube making methods are restricted to production of tubes with a diameter to thickness ratio of 65:1, when 100:1 is required, there has been limited uptake of this technology. However, the Corus tubular blank process allows a greater diameter to thickness ratio and so has more potential for wide spread use in Chassis applications. The major technical issue concerned with the manufacture of Corus tubular blanks is the effect of material elastic recovery (measured through springback) after forming has taken place.</p>
            
            <p>This project will develop a Fuzzy Neural Network model (the so called ANFIS architecture) for springback prediction and in the process identify the important design and process variables associated with springback. The predictions from the model will then be compared to those obtained using existing predictive models.

          <p>The use of bladed discs has the potential to eliminate complex aerofoil attachment arrangements that can result in a substantial reduction in weight. For this project you will be presented with the results from a systematic study of the effect of process variables on the mechanical properties of friction welded Ti-64 aero engine blades. The objective of the project will then be to build a Fuzzy Neural Network model (the so called ANFIS architecture) model of this friction welding process. This will be compared to the results obtained using a response surface methodology. From these models you will seek those manufacturing conditions that maximise the degree of upset in the finished welds and minimise the variability in upset around this maximum.</p>

          <p>In the production of new alloys for engineering applications at high temperature, creep lifing is extremely important. Premature failures can have catastrophic consequences that under some circumstances can involve expensive application shut downs, or even potentially loss of life. As such, a number of predictive techniques can be applied to predict long term creep lives based only on short term data, thus saving on protracted and expensive testing programmes. The current project seeks to evaluate these methods for modern power plant steels, including the most up to date revisions made to the recently devised ‘Wilshire equations’.</p>

          <p>Al-alloys are increasingly being used to replace steel in many structural applications due to their good corrosion performance and better specific strength. The use of Al-alloys is expected to increase significantly in automotive applications to reduce vehicle weight, fuel consumption, and CO2 emission. Throughout the UK and EU, Al-alloys are being used to completely replace galvanised-steel street and motorway lighting columns. Welding is used as the most common joining method for Al-parts. However, the heat-affected region created due to welding may render some of these joints susceptible to failure in demanding applications where high stress and environment factors play a decisive role. This is more critical in heat treatable high strength alloys where the strength loss due to welding may be prevalent in the heat affected zones and failure may occur due to stress, corrosion or a combination of both. The aim of the project is to investigate the structure, property and corrosion behaviour of welded joints from heat treatable aluminium-alloys. The effect of designed thermal treatments on improving the joint properties will be explored if time permits.</p>

          <p>Magnesium is the lightest of all structural material and a promising candidate for aerospace, automotive and other structural applications due to their high specific strength and stiffness, good damping properties, good electromagnetic shielding and ease of machining. Advanced Mg-alloys are now being used in helicopters and it is anticipated that proper alloy and process development will significantly increase the use of Mg-alloys in cars. Magnesium car can very effectively address the necessary fuel and emission reduction as required by the ever stringent environment legislations. Drawback of magnesium alloys are low absolute strength, poor corrosion performance and manufacturing cost too prohibitive for mass application in the automotive industry. Many alloys have been developed with improved corrosion property and can be manufactured cost effectively through high-speed die casting. However, majority of the cast alloys are not designed to be heat treated to improve strength, and show poor mechanical property following processing. A new and promising development to address the shortcoming of Mg processing is the development of semisolid processing routes that promise to significantly improve and refine the cast structure, eliminate defects and improve mechanical property of the components processed in near-net shape. Such development can significantly reduce the cost of processing and mechanical performance of Mg-components by combining elements from casting and solid state processing together. In the present work, a systematic study will be undertaken to investigate and compare the structure and property of advanced magnesium alloy processed through conventional HPDC and semisolid HPDC. Based on the results the relative strengths and shortcomings of the new technology will be evaluated.</p>

          <p>A large percentage of steel is used in the construction industry and increasingly in the pre-painted form in structures such as the Millennium stadium in Cardiff, Supermarkets, DIY stores and large warehouses. Here the paint is applied by the steel maker and simply assembled onsite. These materials have long warranty periods of up to 40 years and failure generally occurs at the cut-edge of the material where metal is exposed and may corrode allowing the paint to peel off. To combat cut-edge corrosion the steels are coated with a zinc alloy and additions of corrosion inhibitors are made to the paint layers to retard corrosion. These inhibitors are critical and have traditionally been based on chromate systems. However, the chromium (VI) ions are carcinogenic and the use of such materials is being reduced through stringent legislation. Thus, steel companies are driven to find effective Chromate free systems that offer comparable corrosion resistance. This project will encompass a detailed literature survey of the current advances in chrome free technologies involving novel systems such as titanates, phosphates, ion exchange systems etc. to enable Tata steel to develop the coatings of the future.</p>

          <p>Zn-Al-Mg alloys potentially offer substantially increased corrosion protection for steels used in a variety of applications from advanced car bodies to construction. The microstructure of the alloy is critical in determining the mechanical and corrosion properties of the materials. Additional elements such as Titanium and Germanium maybe added to the alloys in small quantities to vastly alter the microstructures and potentially their physical and chemical properties. This project will involve a detailed literature search of the current thinking behind grain refinement and also potentially mechanical tests of modified alloys. This work is industrially linked to Tata Steel and the student will work closely with both academics and industrialists in this critical work. The experimental work in the project will take place in Swansea University and also the new state of the art £20 million SPECIFIC research facility in the Baglan Innovation centre, Baglan Bay and thus the student must be willing to travel to this facility. The centre has brand new, state of the art experimentation apparatus and thus provides an excellent research environment and a great opportunity to interface directly with industrial research.</p>

          <p>This project will develop novel production technology for low-cost Concentrator PV (CPV) using reclaimed silicon wafers from the semiconductor industry with low-cost concentrator lenses.</p>
            
            <p>Low-cost photovoltaics (PV) will be the major sustainable, clean energy solution for future energy demands. Silicon dominates PV technology (80% PV market share) and PV technology roadmaps predict that silicon cells will continue to be the primary source of solar power.</p>
            
            <p>Following the new government Feed-in Tariff (FIT) scheme, introduced to promote uptake of renewable electricity generation technologies, the demand for solar power is booming.</p>
            
            <p>Standard silicon cells have good efficiencies but require high energy inputs during manufacturing. Silicon wafers, reclaimed from the semiconductor industry (ideal for PV cells), do not require any thermal processing. Recycled wafers thus represent the greenest possible silicon PV option with energy payback times reduced by more than 5 times. Innovative large area (250 mm sq.) cells from reclaimed wafers will be integrated with novel low-cost Concentrating Photovoltaic (CPV) modules operating at 10 to 20 suns (20 times normal sun intensity). This could yield up to 20 times more power than a standard PV module. The static module will use a novel sunlight trapping and focusing to maximise cell light capture and will avoid costly tracking and cooling systems. These modules could be used as remote off-grid power generation sources or for grid connected power.</p>
            
            <p>This project will develop new R&amp;D technology for sustainable energy generation in collaboration with advanced manufacturing companies in the local area.</p>

          <p>Finite element stress analysis is an extremely powerful computation method for predicting displacements, stresses and strains in components and structures subject to tension, compression, bending, torsion, shear and pressure and, in many cases, combinations of two or more of these fundamental loading types.</p>
            
            <p>It is an approximate method and so the accuracy of the predictions depends, to a great extent, on the model. Stress concentrations can be produced by real effects such as holes, fillets etc. or unrealistic effects such as point loads. In the latter case, the predictions can be highly unrealistic and methods to take account of these high predicted stresses have been proposed.</p>
            
            <p>This numerical project will involve looking at a number of stress concentration features, using finite element analysis, and assessing the suitability of the proposed methods in ‘smoothing out’ the localised high stresses so that the predictions are more realistic.</p>

          <p>For those that watch Mythbusters, there was an episode where they experimented in making a concrete glider. This project will aim at doing the same thing. The project will look at what defines a glider and how they are usually made. The project will then go on to look at various types of concrete which made be used for making a glider, followed by casting, building and testing methods for a small prototype.</p>

          <p>The aim of this project is to investigate the mechanical properties of ZnO nanostructures using atomic force microscopy. ZnO nanoparticles are currently used in the paints and cosmetics industry. Novel ZnO nanostructures such as nanowires have many potential applications and are ideal building blocks for nanoscale devices. Because of their small size, they have novel and exciting properties that can be harnessed into these nano-devices, with potential applications in many areas such as gas sensing, bio-sensing, nanomedicine, electronics and optoelectronics. During this project, the student will use an Atomic force microscope to probe the mechanical response of vertical arrays of ZnO nanowires, using the AFM cantilever to load the nanowires with nano newton forces and measure their stiffness.</p>

          <p>This computational project looks at the physics of long chain polymer molecules. An individual polymer molecule can exhibit conformations ranging from a densely packed globule to a highly extended structure. This project will use numerical methods to simulate polymer conformations and hence calculate the probability distribution function P(R,N) of an isolated polymer chain in solution (P(R,N)= the probability that a polymer of degree of polymerisation N has an end-to-end vector of magnitude R). The project will then look at either i) the effect of polymer-solvent interactions on conformation or ii) simulations of dynamics using either Monte Carlo of molecular dynamics techniques.</p>

          <p>Phase separation in binary liquid mixtures occurs when an initially homogeneous system breaks up into two co-existing phases. For example, a mixture of two polymers can undergo separation into two phases (each phase being highly concentrated in only one of the two polymers) in response to a change in temperature. This computational project will use finite-difference methods to simulate the time development of the phase-separating morphology both in liquid mixtures in one dimension (see Ball &amp; Essery J. Phys.; Condens. Matter 2 (1990) 10303).</p>

          <p>Conjugated polymers are relatively new materials that consist of alternating double &amp; single carbon-carbon bonds along the backbone of the polymer. This structure leads to the delocalisation of electrons along the polymer backbone. This delocalisation enables electrical conduction to occur within a single polymer molecule and gives rise to the semiconducting &amp; light-emitting properties exhibited by many different conjugated polymers. However, it also greatly increases the stiffness of the polymer chains and is expected to influence the flow behaviour of the polymers when molten.</p>
            
            <p>This project involves an extensive literature survey on the flow properties of both molten conjugated polymers and conjugated polymers in solution. The focus of the survey should be on i) what are the mechanical flow properties (rheology) of these polymers and how do they differ from other polymeric and liquid-crystalline materials? ii) how can conjugated polymers be applied to substrates to make electronic circuits via printing &amp; patterning techniques? iii) can the mechanical flow properties of conjugated polymers be exploited to improve performance in plastic electronic devices such as diodes and transistors?</p>
