        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Fibre Bragg grating (FBG) based optical sensors have become widely known and popular because they are immune to electromagnetic radiation, multiplexing capability, high durability, light weight and easy to embed in the composites, therefore they can be used for different sensing applications. There are several methods to interrogate a FBG sensor system. You will perform a literature review of the state-of-the-art and compare their advantages and drawbacks to practical implementation. A selected method will be implemented and tested in the laboratory.</p>

An individual polymer molecule can exhibit conformations ranging from a densely packed globule to a highly extended structure. This project will use numerical methods to simulate polymer conformations and hence calculate the probability distribution function P(R,N) of an isolated polymer chain in solution (P(R,N)= the probability that a polymer of degree of polymerisation N has an end-to-end vector of magnitude R). The project will then look at either i) the effect of polymer-solvent interactions on conformation or ii)  simulations of dynamics using either Monte Carlo of molecular dynamics techniques.</p>

          <p>Phase separation in binary liquid mixtures occurs when an initially homogeneous system breaks up into two co-existing phases. For example, a mixture of two polymers can undergo separation into two phases (each phase being highly concentrated in only one of the two polymers) in response to a change in temperature. This computational project will use finite-difference methods to simulate the time development  of the phase-separating morphology both in liquid mixtures in one dimension (see Ball &amp; Essery J. Phys.; Condens. Matter 2 (1990) 10303).</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Conjugated polymers are relatively new materials that consist of alternating double &amp; single carbon-carbon bonds along the backbone of the polymer. This structure leads to the delocalisation of electrons along the polymer backbone. This delocalisation enables electrical conduction to occur within a single polymer molecule and gives rise to the semiconducting &amp; light-emitting properties exhibited by many different conjugated polymers. However, it also greatly increases the stiffness of the polymer chains and is expected to influence the flow behaviour of the polymers when molten.</p>
            
            <p>This project involves an extensive literature survey on the flow properties of both molten conjugated polymers and conjugated polymers in solution. The focus of the survey should be on i) what are the mechanical flow properties (rheology) of these polymers and how do they differ from other polymeric and liquid-crystalline materials? ii) how can conjugated polymers be applied to substrates to make electronic circuits via printing &amp; patterning techniques? iii) can the mechanical flow properties of conjugated polymers be exploited to improve performance in plastic electronic devices such as diodes and transistors?</p>
