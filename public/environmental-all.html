          <p>Internal lit photobioreactors are potentially a solution to produce algae and algae related products from alternatives. The aim of this project is to investigate the advances and disadvantages of such an approach and investigate the important cost and NW Europe (even S Wales! such as Port Talbot). This will involve making a simple scalable unit design, some spreadsheet modelling to determine the importance of scale and land use on this process. The final aim would be to determine the investment in this high technology solution is a better option to more simple approaches such as externally lit systems.</p>

          <p>One of the challenges of the sludge disposal is the high nutrient content of of the fluids from anaerobic digesters. With the ever increasing values and impact of phosphate and ammonia, these materials could be recovered from digester fluids. This project is to review the potential process that could be used to recovery ammonia and phosphates from AD sludge and the potential benefits of these processes. The impacts are considerable considering the problems with phosphate mining and the production of ammonia by conventional; catalytic systems (high C footprint, diminishing resources etc)</p>

          <p>Lead is a cumulative poison that affects the nervous system and can retard some aspects of child development (both size and intelligence).  Lead pipes were used up to the 1980s both for connecting a property to the water supply main and for internal plumbing, due to lead's strength, malleable nature and resistance to corrosion. In the UK, about 40% of properties are supplied via a lead pipe. Elsewhere in Europe, the estimated percentage of properties supplied by lead pipe-work varies from &lt; 5 to 50 per cent.</p>
            
            <p>Problems with sampling for determining compliance need to be more clearly understood and the specification of a harmonised sampling methodology by the European Commission is <a href="http://www.ciwem.org/knowledge-networks/panels/water-supply--quality/lead-in-drinking-water.aspx">long over-due</a>.</p>
            
            <p>The aim of this project is to initially review the techniques used throughout the world to ascertain lead concentration in drinking water. The second part of the project will create a computational model that will allow comparison of the abilities of the techniques to predict compliance (using Matlab or other language the student is familiar with).</p>

          <p>Extracting energy from the marine environment using tidal stream turbines is an area that is attracting a lot of interest currently. However, in order to reap the most benefit from this technology in the future it will be necessary to deploy farms/arrays of turbines. These arrays will need to be configured so that the optimum performance can be achieved across the array. Each turbine will remove some energy from the tidal stream so the performance will be dependent on the spacing between the turbines, both laterally and longitudinally. This project will involve optimising the configuration of an array of tidal stream turbines using previously obtained computational model data for a single turbine over a range of current speeds.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Desalination involves several technologies used to remove excess salts and other minerals from water. The aim of this process is to produce relatively freshwater from seawater suitable for agriculture and animal consumption. In cases where almost all the salt is processed out of the feed water, it may be suitable for human consumption. Desalination provides a sustainable source of freshwater for countries with limited water supplies especially in the arid regions or in times of long drought. . This project is targeted for students with good background in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering and/or chemistry. The student is expected to critically review thermal desalination techniques showing their advantages and disadvantages in terms of effectiveness and energy costs.</p>

          <p>Membrane technology is applied in many sectors including water treatment, food, pharmaceutical industries. There are a number of types of membranes modules including spiral wound which suffers from deposition of unwanted materials (fouling) leading to a huge reduction in efficiency.  This project is targeted for students with good background in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering and/or chemistry. The student is expected to critically review fouling in spiral wound membranes and consequences in terms of operation and costs.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The accurate monitoring of electricity consumption is prerequisite for efficient and economic usage of electric power. The global quest for efficient and lower power consumption of modern society is widespread effort.
            In this project, we would like to contribute with our small bit and investigate how usage of young people in high education is govern. The main goal is to achieve the same as for rest of the population, efficient usage and minimum waste of electric power. This aim will also result in lowering of costs for electricity usage. On the other hand, this is very challenging task as the behaviour of university students is highly unpredictable, is expected to be with out significant pattern and might be accompanied by ignorance. The project will aim to identify this behaviour and patterns while also suggesting proper solutions.</p>
