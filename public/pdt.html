        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Smart Metering in one of the government’s priority technologies in reducing the carbon emission until 2020, and an investment of around £4-7Bil is expected in this technology in the coming years. Automatic Meter Reading is the technology of automatically collecting data from a utility metering device and transferring that data to a central database for billing and/or analysis. This saves employee trips, and means that billing can be based on actual consumption rather than on an estimate based on previous use, giving customers better control of their consumption of the utility under consideration. They can tell people about their utility use through either linked display units or other ways, such as through the internet or television. Among other potential benefits, they could offer utility customers accurate bills and provide information that could help them use less energy and encourage energy efficiency.</p>
            
            <p>During this project, student will analyse data recorded by the smart electricity meter and design the colour graphic display to present the data in a way that would appeal to the costumers and inspire them to reduce their electric energy consumption.</p>

          <p>Producers of architectural steel cladding are continuing to develop products with added value, comprising coatings which have a function over and above that of simply protecting the underlying steel. One such product under current development is cladding steel coated with a photocatalytic layer, which can self-clean by harnessing solar energy to break-down dirt and grime. Potentially such technology could also be employed to purify rain-water falling on to the coated panel surface. The aim of this project is to review the current state of the art in self-cleaning coated materials for use in construction. A second aim will then be to design an industrial building which can efficiently utilize self-cleaning architectural steel panel and window technologies. The building should make optimum use of incident sunlight and comprise a system to re-circulate rain water which will have been purified by sustained contact with the self-cleaning layers.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Hydrogen is currently perceived as the fuel of the future, offering zero carbon dioxide emission and few of the other pollution issues associated with the combustion of fossil fuels. In addition the plentiful source of raw material (water), coupled with the ready availability of many mature hydrogen-based engine, fuel cell and storage technologies make hydrogen fuel an attractive green option. Hydrogen is generated via the electrolysis of water, a process which must be carried out using renewable energy sources for the true benefits of hydrogen fuel to be realised. Since the early seventies, it has been known that solar energy can be used to split water into its constituents using titanium dioxide photo-catalytic electrodes. The aim of this project is to review all significant developments in the field of solar hydrogen generation since this initial breakthrough. In addition, a second component of the project will involve designing solar cell and associated storage facilities to enable the most promising technologies to be applied on a large scale.</p>

          <p>In collaboration with a local medical company the project will examine the design of wound dressings. At Swansea we are incorporating printed electronics into wound dressings to deliver therapeutic processes while monitoring the wound healing process. A review of wound dressing designs will be undertaken followed by a collation of the design criteria. This will then be applied to the design of smarter wound dressings, starting with simple potential products, but looking to the near future when more elaborate technology can be integrated into the dressings.</p>
