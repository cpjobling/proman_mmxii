        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The Head of Teaching is keen to exploit technology to improve the range and scope of experiences available to students in Engineering. One of his ideas is to develop a library of examples in Matlab and/or Mathematica that can be used to demonstrate important engineering principles in lectures and could serve as tutorial problems. Electrical engineering is already a subject that is well served by such examples. The aim of this project would be survey the examples already available from the Mathworks and Wolfram and, with the help of lecture staff, identify new topics that can be illustrated in similar ways. It is expected that the student will also develop some demonstrations as well. Some example topics are signals and systems theory, control systems, modulation in communications, circuit modelling and simulation, three-phase and power systems, electromagnetism and antennas. An important requirement will be the exploitation of the user interface features provided by Matlab and/or Mathematica to create easy to use and compelling simulations. The resulting library will need to be well documented, usable by both staff and students, and easy to extend in the future. Examples that can be delivered on mobile devices such as smart phones or table PCs will be of particular interest. As inspiration for these see the Mobile and Tablet Apps page at Wolfram|Alpha http://products.wolframalpha.com/mobile/.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The widespread use of mobile phones creates opportunities for collection of various data about the environment. Thus, every mobile phone can be equipped with one or more sensors to obtain measurements from its immediate surroundings. For example, such measurements allow to map the local weather (barometric pressure, temperate and air humidity) or monitor the air quality. This student project will specify new applications that exploit data provided by different kind of sensors in the mobile phones. The specification will consider the associated signal processing in the data fusion centres and also take into account practical design constraints such as the cost of the sensors, the selective geographical and time availability of measurements, varying accuracy and reliability of the measurements, possible privacy issues, increased energy consumption in the mobile phones etc.</p>

          <p>The student should develop a program (Matlab) to simulate a diode-pumped laser system. Experimental data will be provided for the student to validate the program. The project output should be a set of simulation in order to provide optimization of laser for environmental applications (e.g. wind detection and pollution detection). This will enable climate change monitoring. Matlab skills are requested as well as basic math. Writing skills would be a plus since data could be used for a publication on leading international journals.</p>

          <p>Solar cell is one of the most common and affordable form of renewable energy. The solar cell industry has been growing rapidly and strongly in recent years due to concern in climate change and high oil price. However, the efficiency of most solar cells is still relatively low and highly efficiency solar cell is critical in decreasing the cost of solar energy. In this project, the student will investigate the use of metal nano-particles to improve the efficiency of solar cell through plasmonic effect.</p>

          <p>The Micromouse group design exercise is a feature of the level two labs in Electrical and Electronic degree programmes. In session 2010/2011 a project student explored a new way of building a micromouse, using individual modules each with its own micro controller. This has many advantages if the project is to be tackled by a group. So far, three modules have been constructed: motor control, floor sensors, and RS-232 interface. Each has its own, low-cost micro controller.</p>

          <p>Due to the rapid advancement in wireless technology and the popularity of portable devices, there has been a growing interest in location awareness services. The wireless network infrastructure can be used as the basis for an indoor positioning system and it has become a viable option, with the prevalence of wireless hotspots and wireless area networks. In this project, we investigate location tracking and navigation algorithms for indoor mobile devices based on the received signal strengths from three or more Wi-Fi access points, from which we calculate the distances from the access points and then obtain the location of the device. The simulation platform based on OMNeT++/INET will be provided to a student as a starting point.</p>

          <p>The development of miniaturised integrated systems for detection of disease biomarkers, at clinically relevant concentrations in biological samples, and drug delivery for application in early diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of diseases.</p>

            <p>This project will develop an integrated biosensor and drug delivery system. The sensor will be based on a “bioreceptor”-functionalised silicon nanowire (SiNW) capable of detecting biomarkers in blood, urine or even breath. The biosensor consists of a molecule attached to the SiNW surface, which is capable of interacting selectively with a specific target biomarker. This binding event between the charged biomarker and the bioreceptor produces a change in the charge density at the nanochannel / nanowire surface, that can be detected as a change in the electrical behaviour of the sensor device (essentially, a depletion of the nanochannel resulting in a change in the channel resistance).</p>

          <p>Gas sensors based on polycrystalline metal oxide semiconductors offer many advantages over current technologies for detecting reducing gases (H2, CO, CH4) , such as low cost, long lifetime and high sensitivity. The sensing mechanism is based on changes in conductivity of the sensing film induced by chemical reactions between target gases and oxygen species adsorbed onto the film surface. Sensors usually operate at elevated temperature to promote chemical reactions. Additionally, sensors made with nano-sized particles exhibit a much higher sensitivity compared with micron sized particles. In this project, sensing devices will be fabricated using ZnO nanostructures such as nanocrystals and nanowires. The project will involve measuring the conductivity response of the devices as a function of their temperature and gaseous environment (vacuum, air, inert atmosphere and target gases) using a Keithley pico-Ammeter. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) will also be used to characterise the nanoscale structure of the sensing device. SEM allows imaging down to a resolution of 1 nanometre.</p>

          <p>The water in our taps is purified to a high standard. It is a pity that a lot of this water is used for not particularly pure purposes, e.g. watering the garden or flushing the lavatory. The use of rainwater and &#8220;grey&#8221; water (e.g. bath water) is generally suitable for these purposes.</p>
            
            <p>This project will look at the current systems for harvesting rainwater and &#8220;grey&#8221; water, and a new management system will be proposed based on a microcontroller with suitable sensors and actuators.</p>
            
            <p>The use of photovoltaic electricity will also be investigated to reduce the cost of operation of the system.</p>

          <p>This project relates to Solar PV electricity generation and the siting of the panels. Part one of the project is to analyse recorded data sets of solar PV generation from three local installations. The idea is estimate the optimum fixed position in order to maximise generation in the Swansea area. From this information it should then be possible to generalise for different locations, knowing the sun&#8217;s trajectories through the year.</p>

          <p>Taking the latest in computing and communications technology to make the electrical system more interactive, efficient, and robust is the new hot idea. In US more than 10 billion federal dollars are being poured into it. The important issues that needed to be investigate are (a) How Smart Can You and Your Local Electricity Grid Get?: smart-distribution and home-monitoring (b) Toward a Renewables-Friendly Grid: Integrating Solar and Wind and others (c) Cyber Security (d) Computer Modeling (e) The other associated hardware changes.</p>
