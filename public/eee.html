        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The widespread use of mobile phones creates opportunities for collection of various data about the environment. Thus, every mobile phone can be equipped with one or more sensors to obtain measurements from its immediate surroundings. For example, such measurements allow to map the local weather (barometric pressure, temperate and air humidity) or monitor the air quality. This student project will specify new applications that exploit data provided by different kind of sensors in the mobile phones. The specification will consider the associated signal processing in the data fusion centres and also take into account practical design constraints such as the cost of the sensors, the selective geographical and time availability of measurements, varying accuracy and reliability of the measurements, possible privacy issues, increased energy consumption in the mobile phones etc.</p>

          <p>The student should develop a program (Matlab) to simulate a diode-pumped laser system. Experimental data will be provided for the student to validate the program.
            The project output should be a set of simulation in order to provide optimization of laser for environmental applications (e.g. wind detection and pollution detection).
            This will enable climate change monitoring.
            Matlab skills are requested as well as basic math. Writing skills would be a plus since data could be used for a publication on leading international journals.</p>

          <p>This project will review the current applications of nanowires, which vary from probes to wire antenna. The project will concentrate on optical frequencies where metals such as gold, silver and copper have significantly differing characteristics. The aim of the project will be to collect data and test an existing in-house modelling facility on various structures to determine its effectiveness in capturing the optical characteristics of nanowires.</p>

          <p>There have been some interesting structures proposed recently for producing circular polarisation from printed antenna. The successful operation of such structures would be particularly important as microwave antennas for onboard satellite systems.
            This project will initially test an existing design using an antenna simulator and then develop a procedure to improve its performance.</p>

          <p>Silicon based power devices’ technology is reaching its maturity and is not able to deliver a further significant improvement in power conversion. The replacement by wide-bandgap III-Nitrides already demonstrating significant leaps in the performance of power devices is inevitable. The major current drawback issues preventing industrial fabrication are current collapse which reduces output power of the devices and device degradation affecting reliability into such degree that commercial exploitation is largely limited. Therefore, we would focus our project to tackle these two phenomena by i) investigating I-V characteristics of operation GaN HEMTs in order to gain physical understanding of mechanisms causing the current collapse and the device degradation, ii) build relevant physical models of the device using commercial tools (Silvaco).</p>

          <p>CMOS technology experienced a revolutionary change with the introduction of Hafnium-based high-κ dielectrics and metal gates by Intel at the 45 nm technology. Hafnium oxide remained at the 32 nm will remind at the 22 nm technology. Intensive academic and industry research demonstrates that beyond 22 nm CMOS technology, devices based on silicon channel will not be able to deliver the on-current prescribed by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. Radical changes need to be introduced in the device architecture and therefore Intel will start mass production in the 22 nm technology using a non-planar architecture. This has triggered also research in alternative, high-mobility materials like Ge for p-type MOSFET and III-Vs for n-type MOSFET motivated by a state-of-the-art predictive device modelling.
            In this project, we will upgrade the current Si bulk Monte Carlo code written in Fortran to be capable to simulate also III-V semiconductor materials. The update will build on the existing III-V bulk Monte Carlo code with simplified band structure which will allow for transfer of material parameters across. The new code will be evaluate against results from the existing III-V bulk Monte Carlo code and against experimental data.</p>
