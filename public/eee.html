          <p>This project will use an in-house designed thermal transient measurement kit to thermally characterize different power deevices. Then, in-house designed extraction software based on deconvolution method, as well as MATHEMATICA software will be used to extract thermal models of the device (RC thermal networks). The temperature of the IGBT bipolar devices will be estimated analyzing current switch-off transient chatacteristics.</p>

          <p>Location Based Services (LBS) and the associated technologies are fundamental to many of the mobiles services that we enjoy today in our daily life. We are developing a framework for location based services on the University campus. There are a number of strands of work that you could involve in from design of a location based service or analysis of location data. The student will join an existing research group working to develop various aspects of location based technologies and services and this project will supplement to the existing research being carried out by the group. You are expected to have fairly good skills and interest in ICT technologies, programming and simulations.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Silicon based power devicesâ€™ technology is reaching its maturity and is not able to deliver a further significant improvement in power conversion. The replacement by wide-bandgap III-Nitrides already demonstrating significant leaps in the performance of power devices is inevitable. The major current drawback issues preventing industrial fabrication are current collapse which reduces output power of the devices and device degradation affecting reliability into such degree that commercial exploitation is largely limited. Therefore, we would focus our project to tackle these two phenomena by i) investigating I-V characteristics of operation GaN HEMTs in order to gain physical understanding of mechanisms causing the current collapse and the device degradation, ii) build relevant physical models of the device using commercial tools (Silvaco).</p>
