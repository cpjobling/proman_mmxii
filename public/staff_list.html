        Please note that this list is sorted by your email address. Thus c.p.jobling comes before s.g.r.bown. I could potentially do this smarter, but this is the easiest way to present the data that has been collected with the tools that I am using.

          Grain refinining Al-alloys using high-intensity ultrasound
        </h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Due to their low density and good environmental stability Al-alloys are increasingly being considered as the preferred structural material replacing steel. This trend is likely to increase further in the automotive sector in order to reduce car weight, fuel consumption and achieve lower CO2 emissions. Despite their superior specific strength, Al-alloys have only been used in prestige cars due to the high processing cost and relatively lower strength. In order to achieve widespread Al usage in consumer vehicles, strength and cost reduction has become essential. Both mechanical strength and solid state processability (thus, reduced processing cost) can be improved by grain refinement. Although chemical grain refinement is now a standard industrial practice for Al, it has limitations such as unused inoculant particles severely reduce the fatigue performance (major concern for aerospace and automotive usage). Most importantly, chemical inoculation only works for a handful of alloys and is mostly ineffective in many commercially important Alloys. Current research has demonstrated that use of high-energy ultrasound during solidification can lead to dramatic microstructural refinement in a wide range of light alloys. This promising technology can lead to a physical grain refinement mechanism that can address the limitations of conventional techniques and lead to Al-alloys with better property, superior fatigue performance and universal applicability irrespective of alloy additions. In this work the effectiveness of high-intensity ultrasonic irradiation on grain refinement will be explored in various Al-alloys.</p>

          Structure and property degradation in Welded Al-alloy joints
        </h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Al-alloys are increasingly being used to replace steel in many structural applications due to their good corrosion performance and better specific strength. The use of Al-alloys is expected to increase significantly in automotive applications to reduce vehicle weight, fuel consumption, and CO2 emission. Throughout the UK and EU, Al-alloys are being used to completely replace galvanised-steel street and motorway lighting columns. Welding is used as the most common joining method for Al-parts. However, the heat-affected region created due to welding may render some of these joints susceptible to failure in demanding applications where high stress and environment factors play a decisive role. This is more critical in heat treatable high strength alloys where the strength loss due to welding may be prevalent in the heat affected zones and failure may occur due to stress, corrosion or a combination of both. The aim of the project is to investigate the structure, property and corrosion behaviour of welded joints from heat treatable aluminium-alloys. The effect of designed thermal treatments on improving the joint properties will be explored if time permits.</p>

          Comparison of structure and mechanical property in magnesium alloys processed through convention high-pressure die casting and newly-developed rheodiecasting.
        </h4>

          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Magnesium is the lightest of all structural material and a promising candidate for aerospace, automotive and other structural applications due to their high specific strength and stiffness, good damping properties, good electromagnetic shielding and ease of machining. Advanced Mg-alloys are now being used in helicopters and it is anticipated that proper alloy and process development will significantly increase the use of Mg-alloys in cars. Magnesium car can very effectively address the necessary fuel and emission reduction as required by the ever stringent environment legislations. Drawback of magnesium alloys are low absolute strength, poor corrosion performance and manufacturing cost too prohibitive for mass application in the automotive industry. Many alloys have been developed with improved corrosion property and can be manufactured cost effectively through high-speed die casting. However, majority of the cast alloys are not designed to be heat treated to improve strength, and show poor mechanical property following processing. A new and promising development to address the shortcoming of Mg processing is the development of semisolid processing routes that promise to significantly improve and refine the cast structure, eliminate defects and improve mechanical property of the components processed in near-net shape. Such development can significantly reduce the cost of processing and mechanical performance of Mg-components by combining elements from casting and solid state processing together. In the present work, a systematic study will be undertaken to investigate and compare the structure and property of advanced magnesium alloy processed through conventional HPDC and semisolid HPDC. Based on the results the relative strengths and shortcomings of the new technology will be evaluated.</p>

          <p>Bicycles have evolved tremendously not only as a means of transportation but also in recreational and sports areas. Today there are bicycles catering for different purpose from street bikes to mountain bikes or sprint bikes used in sports. Naturally, the choices of materials have tremendously evolved for different types of bicycles to tailor the specific properties necessary to fulfill the desired application. In the present research a systematic investigation will be conducted to study the evolution of bicycle frames in terms of materials used. The progressive application of different types of materials of choice for different types of bikes will be documented. A comparison between different traditional and advanced materials will be performed through software analysis to identify their property and suitability for the specific application. Finally, potential applications of advanced materials currently being developed will be explored.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>A prestressed membrane structure is a structural form which, due to its own geometrical shape, boundary conditions (supports) and prestressing loads, is subjected only to in-plane tensile forces, thus compressive/shear forces and bending/torsional moments are not present. Tensile membrane structures (possibly in combination with cable nets) are most often used as roofs as they can economically and attractively span large distances (i.e. the O2 Arena in London or the Olympic Stadium in Munich). Form-finding is the process by which an initial shape is obtained in equilibrium with the prestress pattern, prior to the application of in-service loads (i.e. snow, wind). In this project, various form-finding techniques will be investigated, in the context of cable-nets and tensile membranes, and comparisons will be drawn between them in terms of the resulting final shape.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>This computational project looks at the physics of long chain polymer molecules. An individual polymer molecule can exhibit conformations ranging from a densely packed globule to a highly extended structure. This project will use numerical methods to simulate polymer conformations and hence calculate the probability distribution function P(R,N) of an isolated polymer chain in solution (P(R,N)= the probability that a polymer of degree of polymerisation N has an end-to-end vector of magnitude R). The project will then look at either i) the effect of polymer-solvent interactions on conformation or ii) simulations of dynamics using either Monte Carlo of molecular dynamics techniques.</p>

          <p>Phase separation in binary liquid mixtures occurs when an initially homogeneous system breaks up into two co-existing phases. For example, a mixture of two polymers can undergo separation into two phases (each phase being highly concentrated in only one of the two polymers) in response to a change in temperature. This computational project will use finite-difference methods to simulate the time development of the phase-separating morphology both in liquid mixtures in one dimension (see Ball &amp; Essery J.

          <p>Conjugated polymers are relatively new materials that consist of alternating double &amp; single carbon-carbon bonds along the backbone of the polymer. This structure leads to the delocalisation of electrons along the polymer backbone. This delocalisation enables electrical conduction to occur within a single polymer molecule and gives rise to the semiconducting &amp; light-emitting properties exhibited by many different conjugated polymers. However, it also greatly increases the stiffness of the polymer chains and is expected to influence the flow behaviour of the polymers when molten.</p>
            
            <p>This project involves an extensive literature survey on the flow properties of both molten conjugated polymers and conjugated polymers in solution. The focus of the survey should be on i) what are the mechanical flow properties (rheology) of these polymers and how do they differ from other polymeric and liquid-crystalline materials? ii) how can conjugated polymers be applied to substrates to make electronic circuits via printing &amp; patterning techniques? iii) can the mechanical flow properties of conjugated polymers be exploited to improve performance in plastic electronic devices such as diodes and transistors?</p>

          <p>One of the issues that developers of marine energy devices have to tackle is the way in which the devices are fixed to one location. In the case of tidal stream turbines, the devices may be held in place by drilling and piling into the sea bed or through gravity foundations, but they must be able to withstand the high currents that are present in the deployment locations. Floating wave energy devices are generally moored to the sea-bed, but this has to be done in such a way that will ensure that the motion of the device with respect to the wave climate is not impeded. This project will involve investigating the issues associated with fixing either tidal stream or wave energy devices to their deployment location, and developing a set of rules that should be followed when determining the amount of anchorage required for a particular device.</p>

          <p>Extracting energy from the marine environment using tidal stream turbines is an area that is attracting a lot of interest currently. However, in order to reap the most benefit from this technology in the future it will be necessary to deploy farms/arrays of turbines. These arrays will need to be configured so that the optimum performance can be achieved across the array. Each turbine will remove some energy from the tidal stream so the performance will be dependent on the spacing between the turbines, both laterally and longitudinally. This project will involve optimising the configuration of an array of tidal stream turbines using previously obtained computational model data for a single turbine over a range of current speeds.</p>

Some of these have high backs to add extra support for young children, and children are restrained in the seats using adult seat belts. However, a worrying problem with the booster seats can occur if a young child falls asleep in the car and slumps forward over the belt or to the side, almost sliding out of the belt.

The pipe flow is regularized and controlled by the hydraulic structure whose mechanical behavior is strongly influenced by the dynamic load from flowing water. The project mainly includes two parts: a) Analysis and optimization of pipe flows in the hydraulic system. b) Analysis and design of reinforced concrete tanks according to Eurocode.<br />Dr. Mauricio Lobao from Black &amp; Veatch Ltd.

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>When the wind blows, a floating object will experience a drag force in the direction of the wind. As the object is induced to drift through the water it will experience a hydrodynamic drag force in the opposite direction. Equilibrium results when the wind-induced aerodynamic drag force is balanced by the hydrodynamic drag force. This occurs at the drift velocity. The ratio of the drift velocity to the wind velocity will depend upon the proportion of the object above and below the waterline.</p>
            
            <p>This project will deal specifically with the induced drift velocity for a floating human body. The work is required for forensic analysis in a criminal investigation. In the first stage, the project will take an experimental approach using the wind tunnel and the water tank available in the School and aim to provide a quick but rough estimation of the drift velocity. In the second stage, a computer simulation approach will be taken (using ANSYS CFX, a commercial computational fluid dynamics package) to confirm the experimental result and obtain more detailed prediction.</p>
            
            <p>The project student is expected to have good knowledge in fluid mechanics, strong ability in experimental investigation, and an interest and open mind of computer simulation.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Optimization technology has already been successfully applied in a number of industrial sectors such as automotive and aerospace, and production costs are influenced by minimum mass design solutions which have accounted for manufacturability and repeatability. Similarly, the costs associated with designing and constructing building structures are influenced by manufacturability and repeatability.</p>
            
            <p>The project will use optimization technology to improve the design of advanced structures and reduce the associated cost. The existing commercial FEA package HpyerWorks will be used as the main tool in the project. The project will provide a good training of the use of commercial FEA software, and improve the student’s ability to apply university knowledge in practical engineering problems.</p>
            
            <p>Dr. Stuart Bates in Altair UK (http://www.uk.altair.com/Default.aspx) will be the industrial supervisor, and a few travels to Altair UK (Leamington Spa, Warwickshire) may be required.</p>

          Finite element analysis of wheel chairs

          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The wheelchair is an essential tool for immobile people who wish to travel indoors and out. A reliable wheelchair is essential for accessibility and confidence for the user, failure of the wheelchair frame could cause serious injury and discomfort for the user. A specific problem recognized with wheelchair failure is fatigue fracture in the cross-brace. It is a problem common with manual folding frame wheelchairs. Fatigue failure causes the chair to be inoperable for the user and could cause serious injury depending on the consequences after the failure. In order to avoid critical failures in wheelchair frames, standards are set for manufacturers to follow, theses involve static strength tests and fatigue tests.</p>
            
            <p>This project will investigate the use of finite element analysis to predict the fatigue strength of a wheelchair frame. Due to the inconsistent nature of fatigue many factors are to be considered when assigning a fatigue strength property. The computer simulation will involve both both static and dynamic analysis. The commercial finite element analysis package “ANSYS” will be used as the main tool in the project.</p>
            
            <p>The project student is required to have solid knowledge in both mechanics and mathematics, with strong motivation to work with real engineering problems. From the project, the student will gain knowledge of using computer simulation to assist analysis and design of complicated engineering structures and receive training of combining techniques to solve real engineering challenges.</p>

          <p>The Head of Teaching is keen to exploit technology to improve the range and scope of experiences available to students in Engineering. One of his ideas is to develop a library of examples in Matlab and/or Mathematica that can be used to demonstrate important engineering principles in lectures and could serve as tutorial problems. Electrical engineering is already a subject that is well served by such examples. The aim of this project would be survey the examples already available from the Mathworks and Wolfram and, with the help of lecture staff, identify new topics that can be illustrated in similar ways. It is expected that the student will also develop some demonstrations as well. Some example topics are signals and systems theory, control systems, modulation in communications, circuit modelling and simulation, three-phase and power systems, electromagnetism and antennas. An important requirement will be the exploitation of the user interface features provided by Matlab and/or Mathematica to create easy to use and compelling simulations. The resulting library will need to be well documented, usable by both staff and students, and easy to extend in the future. Examples that can be delivered on mobile devices such as smart phones or table PCs will be of particular interest.

          <p>Polymer photovoltaics have been suggested in recent years as the answer to expensive and rigid photovoltaics that incur high manufacturing costs. Polymer photovoltaics are lightweight and lend themselves to flexible substrates The project will specifically look at the manufacture and design principles of polymer photovoltaics to develop an understanding of stability and efficiency when compared to existing flexible photovoltaic technology. The project will involve polymer solar cell manufacture and characterisation using equipment available at the SPECIFIC laboratories. Solar cells will be built by the solution deposition of organic semiconductor polymer blends between two metallic conductors and characterised using solar simulator instrumentation. The project will form part of increasing activity in the SPECIFIC centre on flexible solar cells as building integrated functional coatings.</p>

          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) have often been described as artificial photosynthesis. A DSC generally consists of a mesoporous TiO layer with a sunlight absorbing dye (much like chlorophyll in green leaves) adsorbed to its surface deposited onto a conducting substrate. An electrolyte solution surrounding the TiO2 and connecting it to a platinised counter electrode completes the photovoltaic circuit. The project will entail developing an understanding into the effects of transferring conventional rigid glass based dye-sensitized solar cell technology onto flexible substrates and any photovoltaic losses. The project will involve the manufacture of rigid and flexible dye-sensitized solar cells on glass and titanium substrates and their characterisation with a particular interest on the substrate - TiO2 interface. This project will be embedded in the SPECIFIC centre within a larger activity aimed at developing energy generating functional coatings for the built environment.</p>

          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Car manufacturers are increasingly using composite materials in an effort to reduce vehicle weight in order to improve fuel economy, CO2 emissions and the carbon footprint. Typically, structural composites have used synthetic reinforcements such as glass and carbon fibres or low cost fillers such as talc. In recent years, the use of natural fibres as a reinforcement has also gained applications as a lightweight and sustainable resource. Additionally, newly developed nanocomposites are starting to make inroads into the vehicle market. However, at the same time, legislation is forcing manufacturers to recycle all end-of-life vehicles, and composite materials in general are more difficult to recycle. This project should aim to review current usage of composites in vehicles including specific case studies and assessment of likely future trends. In addition to the technical aspects, the project might also consider the effects of environmental concerns and legislation.</p>

          Environmentally Friendly Applications for Waste Glass

        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Large quantities of waste glass are currently generated in this country and a variety of applications are being sought. One potential low carbon application is using recycled glass as a heat sink and subsequently as a slow release heat source. It is believed that broken or imploded glass contained in a vessel could act to help stabilise temperatures in contained environments such as green houses and conservatories. It is felt that there could be potential in manufacturing and marketing this as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional heating mechanisms. The aim of the project is to assess the potential for such heat exchange mechanisms to provide small amounts of heating and cooling in contained environments. The project could address some of the following issues: • Heat uptake/release of different types/sizes/arrangements/colours of glass. • Effects of combining glass with different solid and/or liquid materials on heat uptake, retention and release properties. • The potential for heat exchange to warm airflows within contained environments. • Comparison of different system designs. • Practicalities of setting-up and designing an appropriate system.</p>

          Impact and Stress Relaxation in Composites

          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Composites are increasingly being used in structural applications where designers take advantage of their strength and stiffness combined with low density. These properties lend themselves to transport applications, such as the aerospace and automotive industries, where impact damage can be a problem. Another issue with polymer based composites is that they are subject to stress relaxation, that is, if held at a constant strain, the stress reduces with time. In this project it is planned to carry out an investigation into combined effects of impact and stress relaxation by damaging composite samples and then testing their subsequent mechanical properties. It is also hoped that from the results a model can be produced to describe the stress relaxation behaviour.</p>

          <p>Polymers subjected to a combination of stress and a hostile environment may exhibit Environmental Stress Cracking (ESC), depending on the precise conditions. The mechanisms of ESC are not fully understood, and probably vary from one combination of material and liquid to another. This project should aim to investigate these conditions concentrating on a limited combination of material and environments. It is planned to carry out experiments to investigate the effects of stress and environment individually by stressing samples prior to immersion in the environment and immersing other samples prior to application of the stress. This combination of experiments should help to throw light on our understanding of the mechanisms and the relative significance of stress/strain levels and environmental conditions.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Latent fingerprints on items of evidence in criminal investigations are typically visualised by the use of a developer, which increases the optical contrast between the fingerprint pattern and the background surface. Most routine print detection work is carried out using reagents such metal powders, various dyes and superglue. However, for metal surfaces it has been shown that an instrumental technique based on Volta potential mapping using a scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) generates superior results under certain circumstances. The principal aim of this work will be to determine whether or not SKP can visualise fingerprint patterns in instances where recovery of ridge pattern detail has not been satisfactory using various chemical developers. The sensitivity of SKP versus techniques such as superglue fuming and metal deposition will be determined using a fingerprint depletion series approach.</p>

          <p>In order to maintain a strategic advantage over foreign competitors in coated product technology, the UK steel industry is currently developing high performance organic coatings with minimal environmental impact. Thin organic coatings (TOCs) are presently being investigated as one-step alternatives to using costly combinations of pre-treatments, conversion coatings and organic polymer based primer layers which contain anti-corrosion pigments. TOCs are intended for use on steel prior to the application of a topcoat and must confer a level of corrosion protection equivalent to existing technologies. The aim of this project is to identify promising coating systems for use as TOCs at thicknesses of 5 microns or less, along with appropriate methods of application. The most promising candidates will be used to coat relevant metal substrates on a laboratory scale and will be assessed with respect to corrosion resistance using a combination of time-lapse photography and in-situ scanning Kelvin probe analysis. It should be noted that this work will be carried out within the SPECIFIC laboratories in Baglan and that the student should have his or her own transport.</p>

          <p>Producers of architectural steel cladding are continuing to develop products with added value, comprising coatings which have a function over and above that of simply protecting the underlying steel. One such product under current development is cladding steel coated with a photocatalytic layer, which can self-clean by harnessing solar energy to break-down dirt and grime. Potentially such technology could also be employed to purify rain-water falling on to the coated panel surface. The aim of this project is to review the current state of the art in self-cleaning coated materials for use in construction. A second aim will then be to design an industrial building which can efficiently utilize self-cleaning architectural steel panel and window technologies. The building should make optimum use of incident sunlight and comprise a system to re-circulate rain water which will have been purified by sustained contact with the self-cleaning layers.</p>

          <p>Hydrogen is currently perceived as the fuel of the future, offering zero carbon dioxide emission and few of the other pollution issues associated with the combustion of fossil fuels. In addition the plentiful source of raw material (water), coupled with the ready availability of many mature hydrogen-based engine, fuel cell and storage technologies make hydrogen fuel an attractive green option. Hydrogen is generated via the electrolysis of water, a process which must be carried out using renewable energy sources for the true benefits of hydrogen fuel to be realised. Since the early seventies, it has been known that solar energy can be used to split water into its constituents using titanium dioxide photo-catalytic electrodes. The aim of this project is to review all significant developments in the field of solar hydrogen generation since this initial breakthrough. In addition, a second component of the project will involve designing solar cell and associated storage facilities to enable the most promising technologies to be applied on a large scale.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The practice of monitoring respiratory function during exercise is now well established as a training aid in sports science. Spirometry can be used to measure lung capacity, while measurement of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in inhaled/exhaled breath allows calculation of parameters such as peak oxygen uptake (VO2). However, there is increasing interest in monitoring other gases in human exhalations as a means of tracking sporting performance. For example, there is evidence to suggest that certain food supplements or types of diet aimed at sportspeople can lead to heightened levels of atypical species, such as nitric acid or aldehydes in exhaled breath. This project aims to review key developments in the field of in-line breath monitoring applied to sports science. There may also be scope to utilize a newly acquired nitric oxide breath analyser for a preliminary assessment of the exhalation of human subjects both prior to and following consumption of dietary supplements aimed at improved sports performance.</p>

          <p>A newly launched initiative between the colleges of medicine and engineering is looking at the effect of nanoparticles on the human immune system. There are two important reasons for undertaking such a study: i. the increasing use of nanotechnology is raising many questions as to the safety of nanoscale particles and ii. many new medical diagnostic and treatment methods are based on the use of nanoparticles. In this project students will work alongside PhD and postdoctoral researchers looking at the effects of nanoparticles on the human immune system. Fluorescent, polymeric nanobeads will be used with primary blood samples from blood donors. Very little is known about the uptake of nanoparticles into white blood cells or of the influence of age, gender, health status on this. Using flow cytometry the project will quantify the dose of nanoparticles present in each of the important blood cell sub-groups – T-Cells, mononuclear cells, granulocytes and assess the degree of immune response triggered by the nanoparticles by studying cell signalling molecules. Detailed analysis of the data using statistical techniques will provide an insight to the cell-to-cell variability in nanoparticle uptake, the degree of correlation of dose with immune response and the links between cell-level biology and the whole person response.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Nanoparticles are now being widely used in the development of novel medical diagnostic and therapeutic applications; these promise to detect cancer through the imaging of magnetic or fluorescent particles or to treat disease in a targeted manner to individual, diseased cells through nano-delivery vehicles for drugs. All of this is made possible by a natural cellular process - endocytosis, which is the primary route through which cells take up small particles and large molecules from their environment. This process has evolved to be most efficient for particles in the size range of 10-100 nm and so provides an intrinsic delivery route for nanomedicine. However, whilst much observation of nanoparticle uptake through endocytosis has been done there is still no clear understanding of the detailed processes at play and this limits our ability to predict the likely nanoparticle dose. In this project students will work alongside PhD students who are looking at data analysis of nanoparticle uptake into individual cells and developing computational models of the endocytic process.</p>

However, the ball velocity tends to remain constant because the extra mass produces a counteracting decrease in foot velocity.

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Tree shelters are used to protect saplings from brosing damage, weeds and drought conditions. They have a requirement to last a certain time and then break down under the action of UV from sunlight, which requires a detailed understanding of the effects of additives. This project is in collaboration with the world&#8217;s largest supplier of tree shelters and a German University, where a large field trial is underway in Southern Germany. Samples from this trial are available for testing and analysis, and the results will lead to a much better control of the lifetime. The project is mainly experimental, using several techniques; samples taken at different times are available and more will come in during the project.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>This project links in to existing research work, in collaboration with Airbus and Cytec on the modelling of liquid ingress into carbon fibre / epoxy composites. Two important aspects will be examined in this project. Firstly how the distribution of fibres varies with lay-up in thick section composites. There is some evidence that some lay-ups have areas that are resin-rich which will make for easier liquid ingress. This part of the project will involve some detailed microscopy of thick composite samples and image analysis to assess the fibre distribution. In addition, the project will assess how new dynamic mechanical equipment can be used for in-situ measurements of the effects of liquid absorption.</p>

          <p>A method has been identified by which it may be possible to produce flooring mats which have a controllable degree of bounce. This has applications for indoor cricket nets and maybe for other sports. This project will seek to develop a prototype system involving the use of rubbery layers, rigid layers and heating elements. There will be a need to establish the effects of layer thickness and temperature on measured bounce. Although the project is mainly experimental, there is some scope for modelling if this is of interest.</p>

          <p>Recent developments in materials for swim suits has led to improvements in times, to the extent that some materials have been outlawed for competitions. The aim of this project is to establish how competition times have changed with use of different suit designs. Quite a lot of this work will involve data gathering and analysis, for instance an analysis of competition times over recent years and correlation with the introduction of different materials. There may be some scope for some in-pool trials though this depends on availability of volunteers with different suits.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>A large percentage of steel is used in the construction industry and increasingly in the pre-painted form in structures such as the Millennium stadium in Cardiff, Supermarkets, DIY stores and large warehouses. Here the paint is applied by the steel maker and simply assembled onsite. These materials have long warranty periods of up to 40 years and failure generally occurs at the cut-edge of the material where metal is exposed and may corrode allowing the paint to peel off. To combat cut-edge corrosion the steels are coated with a zinc alloy and additions of corrosion inhibitors are made to the paint layers to retard corrosion. These inhibitors are critical and have traditionally been based on chromate systems. However, the chromium (VI) ions are carcinogenic and the use of such materials is being reduced through stringent legislation. Thus, steel companies are driven to find effective Chromate free systems that offer comparable corrosion resistance. This project will encompass a detailed literature survey of the current advances in chrome free technologies involving novel systems such as titanates, phosphates, ion exchange systems etc. to enable Tata steel to develop the coatings of the future.</p>

          <p>The development of renewable energy technologies is of critical importance for the future and thus much research is currently underway to produce energy through sources such as photovoltaic cells and wind. The issue with these technologies are that they are not consistent i.e. for photovoltaic materials electricity is only generated during the day, usually the lowest energy use period for a home. Thus, the energy generated must be stored and released when it is required and this must be achieved through batteries. This project supports the recent investment from EPSRC and industry of £20 million to fund the SPECIFIC research centre in Baglan Bay that is investigating such technologies. The project will encompass a detailed literature survey and evaluation of battery technologies that may be most suitable for the large area dye sensitised solar cells that are being developed within SPECIFIC. The project will also involve thoughts around the best methods and designs of incorporating batteries into steels roofs or roof spaces to maximise efficiencies.</p>

          High Temperature Deformation Characteristics of an Advanced Nickel Based Superalloy

          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Description: If the aerospace industry is to achieve its aim in reducing emissions and impact on the environment, the next generation of jet engines will need to burn fuel more efficiently and at higher temperatures. Building engine components capable of operating under such harsh environments is a technological challenge and while nickel based superalloys offer the heat resistance needed, they are difficult to join using conventional welding techniques. Rolls Royce are tackling this problem by applying inertia welding techniques to the production of compressor drums, turbine discs and shafts for jet engines. Inertia welding uses the heat generated by friction to fuse metal components together. A work piece is spun at high speed on a flywheel and brought into contact with a stationary component. Within seconds, the pieces reach forging temperature at the point of contact and are bonded together without melting or the addition of liquid metal. Rolls Royce are developing a model to simulate this process in the rotor disc alloy, RR1000 in order to optimize the welding process both in terms of structural integrity and to predict/ minimize residual stresses. In order for the model to make accurate predictions, mechanical property data is required as an input, in particular flow stress information obtained from forging tests. The project will involve data analysis for a range of temperatures and strain rates and the development of a curve fitting/ interpolation program. This program should be able to predict the flow stress for a given temperature and strain rate. Ideally the fitting routine should utilise a phenomenological deformation model. Material characterization will also form part of the analysis in order to define failure mechanisms and material stability within the defined test parameters.</p>

          Characterisation of corrosion-fatigue damage in an advanced nickel based superalloy

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Description: The latest generation of nickel based superalloys must offer improved temperature capabilty to aero-engine and land based energy turbine manufacturers in order to improve plant effeciency and meet increasingly stringent envronmental regulations. Due to the combination of alloy metallurgy and extreme operational conditions, such alloys are prone to high temperature oxidation and sulphidation damage that can potentially compromise subsequent mechanical performance.</p>
            
            <p>This short project will characterise surface damage incurred during normal service operation in turbine disc components supplied by Rolls-Royce. As operating conditions (especially temperature) are pushed beyond previously defined design limits, instances of high temperature corrosion are becoming more regular. However, to date the scientific understanding of such damage remains extremely limited. An assessment of ex-service parts is now considered essential since fatigue cracks could initiate from sites of surface corrosion, acting as localised stress raising features (e.g. oxidised grain boundaries and surface inclusions, sulphidation pitting etc). Thus, the project will have direct engineering implications together with academic interest. The project objectives can be summarised as:</p>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Detect instances of surface oxidation / sulphidation in ex-service turbine components</li>

            <li>Create an imaging database to archive instances of such damage</li>

          Small Scale test techniques in linear friction weld development

        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Industry in general is faced with substantial challenges in the field of structural metals if it is to secure future sustainable growth. In order to meet demanding performance and environmental targets a considerable drive to improve upon conventional metallic alloys will be necessary. It is widely considered that improvements to traditional materials via composition optimization alone have been exhausted , therefore, future engineering designs are likely to incorporate innovative processing techniques and ‘hybrid’ components employing dissimilar combinations of two or more alloy variants. Key to achieving this will be the development of novel joining technologies. The capability to join a metal to itself or to a different alloy greatly increases flexibility in design, production and repair when compared with traditional processing routes such as casting or forging and consequently, a wide variety of different joining techniques have been developed. Solid state welding techniques, such as linear friction welding are receiving considerable interest within the aerospace industry in the joining of advanced alloy systems, where these alloys are only joinable via such friction weld based processes</p>
            
            <p>This project will underpin the development of friction welding methods and process models for friction welding of titanium, nickel and steel alloys. The work will develop and understand a small scale disc bend test method, in order to characterize the mechanical properties of development linear friction welds. Carry out a range of tests to build up a database of results to ensure validity of the method and its relevant equations. The technique will be particularly effective when looking into weld simulations on φ10mm cylindrical rods, where the heat/cool treated zone is of a small thickness. Exploration of different heat profiles with the aim to establish effects on microstructure, properties and in turn optimising the process.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Torsion in beams generally arises from the action of shear loads whose point of application does not coincide with the shear centre of the beam section. Codes of Practice require torsional stresses be checked and provided for in design. For general beams, exact solutions of torsion problems normally do not exist and approximate, numerical, methods of analysis must be employed. In this project, we will consider a beams of rectangular cross section, and begin by obtaining an exact solution via a separation of variables method. This will enable us to determine the value of the torsional rigidity of the beam. We will then solve the same problem using MATLAB and a basic finite difference method. The accuracy of the approximation will be demonstrated by comparing the computed and exact values of the torsional rigidity. To finish, we will use a higher order finite difference method and demonstrate its improved accuracy characteristics.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Water hammer is a pressure surge resulting when water in motion is forced to stop or change direction suddenly. At home, water hammer sometime occurs occur when a tap shuts off water flow, causing a loud repetitive banging or shuddering. The process is often simulated using the method of characteristics. We will start by looking at the water hammer problem and will produce a one dimensional model in the form of a coupled pair of equations. We will then look at the method of characteristics and use it initially for a single equation. The extension of the method to handle two coupled equations will then be addressed. The method of characteristics will then be applied to the water hammer equations and an approximate MATLAB implementation will be developed. This will then enable simulations to be performed of the flows resulting from the closure of a downstream valve or a change in pipe cross-section or a pipe branch.</p>

          <p>Fibre-To-The-Home (FTTH) has been considered an ideal solution for access networks due to its huge capacity. To practically and economically implement FTTH in access, Passive Optical Networks (PONs) – based on Time Division Multiplexing, Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), or hybrid TDM/WDM – have been proposed and extensively studied in the literature. The aim of this project is to study various PON architectures proposed for next-generation optical access and evaluate their performances under realistic network and traffic environments using OMNeT++/INET, an open-source, object-oriented simulation framework.</p>

          <p>Due to the rapid advancement in wireless technology and the popularity of portable devices, there has been a growing interest in location awareness services. The wireless network infrastructure can be used as the basis for an indoor positioning system and it has become a viable option, with the prevalence of wireless hotspots and wireless area networks. In this project, we investigate location tracking and navigation algorithms for indoor mobile devices based on the received signal strengths from three or more Wi-Fi access points, from which we calculate the distances from the access points and then obtain the location of the device. The simulation platform based on OMNeT++/INET will be provided to a student as a starting point.</p>

          <p>Back pain is a very common disorder that usually lacks a specific radiological diagnosis and has been termed non-specific chronic. It is widely known that spinal posture can be monitored by an array of strain gauges. The aim of this project is to characterise mechanical/electrical performance of commercially available strain gauges and explores their applications in the area of monitoring spinal posture.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Since the early 1950’s minimill technologies have diffused to become part of the current steel making climate. For example, the share of electric arc steel production in total world crude steel production has risen steadily from the lows of 15% in 1970 to around 35% in 2002. This trend has had profound implications for the structure of the steel industry around the world. The continuation of this trend will also have significant implications for iron ore and coking coal demand in the longer term.</p>
            
            <p>In this project you will research the reasons for this growth in electric arc steel manufacturing and assess the implication for the future of the large integrated plant.

          <p>When designing materials for high temperature service, the design criteria for long term operation must guarantee that creep deformation should not cause excessive distortion over the planned service life and that creep failure should not occur within such a required operating life. Such creep fracture represents an obvious &#8216;life limiting&#8217; design consideration as fracture of pipe work or other major components used by nuclear powered electricity generating plants could prove catastrophic. For this reason, studying their ability to predict the time to rupture strain has been the major criteria used to assess creep extrapolation techniques. One of the major steels used in pipe work in power generation plants is 1Cr-1Mo-0.25V. This project will compare the accuracy of the new “Wilshire” equations with some more traditional parametric techniques in predicting the life of these steels.</p>

        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Tube hydro forming has already proved successful in sub frame and chassis applications. Due to the fact that standard tube making methods are restricted to production of tubes with a diameter to thickness ratio of 65:1, when 100:1 is required, there has been limited uptake of this technology. However, the Corus tubular blank process allows a greater diameter to thickness ratio and so has more potential for wide spread use in Chassis applications. The major technical issue concerned with the manufacture of Corus tubular blanks is the effect of material elastic recovery (measured through springback) after forming has taken place.</p>
            
            <p>This project will develop a Fuzzy Neural Network model (the so called ANFIS architecture) for springback prediction and in the process identify the important design and process variables associated with springback. The predictions from the model will then be compared to those obtained using existing predictive models. Finally, The finished Fuzzy Neural Network will be used to find settings for the process variables that help minimise elastic recovery.</p>

The objective of the project will then be to build a Fuzzy Neural Network model (the so called ANFIS architecture) model of this friction welding process. This will be compared to the results obtained using a response surface methodology. From these models you will seek those manufacturing conditions that maximise the degree of upset in the finished welds and minimise the variability in upset around this maximum.</p>

Wired power is either prohibitively expensive or too risky, while batteries require periodic replacement. One option is to generate power from ambient sources such as solar energy, temperature variation, or structural vibration. This project is concerned with harvesting vibration energy using a piezoelectric patch on a cantilever beam. Most applications of such harvesting devices consider harmonic excitation, whereas in highway bridges the vibration due to traffic is an important energy source and is the subject of this project. The direction on the project will, to some extent, be dictated by the interests and background of the student, but is likely to include the design, analysis and optimisation of the harvester, and building and testing the device to validate the modelling.</p>

          Elastomer Skin for Morphing Aircraft

          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>A variety of designs have been suggested for morphing wings, including compliant ribs, span extension and morphing winglets. These concepts usually require a skin that is flexible, so that the wing can deform, and stiff to withstand the aerodynamic loads. One option to satisfy these conflicting requirements is to employ skins with anisotropic properties, such as corrugated skins or stiffened elastomer skins. This project will consider the design of an elastomer skin to cover a honeycomb wing structure. The direction on the project will, to some extent, be dictated by the interests and background of the student, but is likely to include modelling of the skin deformation and actuator force requirements, the design of suitable skins for typical applications and/or manufacturing and testing stiffened elastomer skins.</p>

Some working models and the wind tunnel setup can be viewed in the wind tunnel lab in Talbot Building. Please contact Prof Friswell or Dr Onur Bilgen (o.bilgen@swansea.ac.uk) to arrange a lab tour. No aircraft background required, however students should be comfortable with design and analysis software (Matlab, Ansys, Solid Works, other CAD packages, LabView, etc.), simple electrical circuits (resistors, capacitors, simple wiring, etc.), fabrication techniques (bonding, vacuum bagging, manual fabrication, etc.) and have an exceptional work ethic.</p>

          <p>Aircraft wings are a compromise that allows the aircraft to fly at a range of flight conditions, but the performance at each condition is sub-optimal. Morphing allows a wing to change its geometry during flight to reduce the design compromises required. Although many concepts have been researched few have entered surface, partly because of certification issues, but also because the benefits of the morphing aircraft have not been demonstrated. This project will consider one of the morphing concepts (for example variable camber, span extension, variable twist, morphing winglets) and a common mission profile (for example UAV surveillance, long range endurance, commercial short/medium/long haul) and investigate the advantages and disadvantages of morphing aircraft by comparing the performance to the optimum conventional solution.</p>

          <p>Central blood pressure is a more accurate indicator of the blood pressure (BP) developed by the heart, peripheral BP measurement being a relatively poor surrogate of this value. Central BP can be estimated non-invasively from arm cuff BP using the pulse wave ‘augmentation index’ (AI). This study will use a newly developed device (the MobilOGraph) to assess the central BP and AI responses to physical exercise in healthy males and females.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Modern medicine has access to many and varied imaging systems providing high resolution data from cell to whole body. These systems are often automated and so generate vast amounts of information which must then be analysed. The trend to ever greater data capture has led to the ‘data problem’ – too much information for human being to analyse; one way around this is to automate the analysis as well as the acquisition of images. In this project students will use a number of matlab-based software routines for the automated recognition and analysis of cells within optical microscopy and electron microscopy images. The issues to be addressed include:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Automated detection and counting of cells within tumour cell populations</li>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The aerospace industry often places extreme demands on materials engineers, with more exotic alloys often required to fulfill the requirements of high temperature/low weights applications. The role of the student in this project will be to collate a wide range of alloys and produce a database in terms of microstructure, mechanical test results (ranked appropriately) and application. The student will be required to perform a significant literature review in order to produce this database, whilst at the same time understanding/performing appropriate polishing/etching procedures to reveal the microstructure of the alloys.</p>

          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The hexagonal close packed nature of the alpha phase titanium lattice leads to the development of a strong crystallographic texture within a number of titanium alloys. This may lead to anisotropic mechanical properties which require full evaluation prior to implementation in engineering applications. Currently there is much focus on the development of ‘macrozones’, areas of common crystallographic orientation which may have a further detrimental effect on mechanical properties. The student will be required to work alongside existing researchers in analysing material behaviour from a number of different microstructural titanium variants. The ultimate aim of the project is the development of understanding of the behaviour of these macrozones, which would lead to an overall improvement in properties which could be beneficial to the aerospace and other sectors.</p>

          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The recently developed Wilshire equations have shown great promise in the creep lifing of a number of different alloys, particularly in the prediction of long term creep behavior based on short term predictions. However, the creep lifing requirements for the aerospace sector differ significantly from the long term nature of the power industry. More important here is the accurate prediction of times to particular strains. Based on these results it has been shown that it is possible to regenerate full creep curves based on limited data. Clearly the Wilshire equations offer exciting new opportunities for the field of creep research. The role of the student in this project will be to work alongside existing researchers in further developing the Wilshire equations for use in the aerospace sector.</p>

          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>In the production of new alloys for engineering applications at high temperature, creep lifing is extremely important. Premature failures can have catastrophic consequences that under some circumstances can involve expensive application shut downs, or even potentially loss of life. As such, a number of predictive techniques can be applied to predict long term creep lives based only on short term data, thus saving on protracted and expensive testing programmes. The current project seeks to evaluate these methods for modern power plant steels, including the most up to date revisions made to the recently devised ‘Wilshire equations’.</p>

          <p>Thermo-mechanical fatigue is considered to be the primary life limiting factor for engineering components in a number of high temperature applications. The gas turbine engine is an area where cyclic variations in temperature introduce thermo-mechanical fatigue, and its effects on high performance nickel alloys are not always well understood. The project will involve the student developing an understanding of the factors involved in TMF, including loading direction, phase angle and temperature range. The student will be expected to analyse existing data produced at Swansea University and draw conclusions using analytical techniques, and SEM analysis of failed specimens.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The removal of hardness to avoid problems is termed as “water-softening”. Water hardness is mainly caused by the presence of the cations calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) and is partially due to aluminium, iron, and other divalent and trivalent cations. Hardness is considered to be an economical disadvantage as it increases soap consumption and fuel costs. A number of techniques are available for water softening. This project is targeted for students with good background in chemistry. The student is expected to critically review these techniques, analyse water in Swansea and come up with a suitable technique for softening.</p>

Desalination provides a sustainable source of freshwater for countries with limited water supplies especially in the arid regions or in times of long drought. .

            <p>This project will develop an integrated biosensor and drug delivery system. The sensor will be based on a “bioreceptor”-functionalised silicon nanowire (SiNW) capable of detecting biomarkers in blood, urine or even breath. The biosensor consists of a molecule attached to the SiNW surface, which is capable of interacting selectively with a specific target biomarker. This binding event between the charged biomarker and the bioreceptor produces a change in the charge density at the nanochannel / nanowire surface, that can be detected as a change in the electrical behaviour of the sensor device (essentially, a depletion of the nanochannel resulting in a change in the channel resistance).</p>

            <p>This integrated system will enable frequent and regular injection of the therapeutic agent via transdermal microneedles to achieve the optimum therapeutic dose for the patient.</p>
            
            <p>The microfluidics and microneedles will be fabricated using new CNH deep-etch and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) tools. The new CNH fabrication facilities have been targeted specifically for this type of research and the project would be one of the first to utilise the photolithography, EBL, etch &amp; deposition, surface and electrical characterisation tools at the CNH. The timing of the PhD studentships will coincide with the installation of the new £600k equipment and the studentships will be an ideal way to generate early momentum and ensure that the facilities have dedicated users who are trained by the equipment manufacturers and will generate immediate outputs for CNH.</p>
            
            <p>The studentship would also coincides with the EPSRC Grand Challenge in Nanohealth, which would directly allocate substantial funds for materials, consumables, investigator time and running costs for the project.

          <p>This project will develop novel production technology for low-cost Concentrator PV (CPV) using reclaimed silicon wafers from the semiconductor industry with low-cost concentrator lenses.</p>
            
            <p>Low-cost photovoltaics (PV) will be the major sustainable, clean energy solution for future energy demands. Silicon dominates PV technology (80% PV market share) and PV technology roadmaps predict that silicon cells will continue to be the primary source of solar power.</p>
            
            <p>Following the new government Feed-in Tariff (FIT) scheme, introduced to promote uptake of renewable electricity generation technologies, the demand for solar power is booming.</p>
            
            <p>Standard silicon cells have good efficiencies but require high energy inputs during manufacturing. Silicon wafers, reclaimed from the semiconductor industry (ideal for PV cells), do not require any thermal processing. Recycled wafers thus represent the greenest possible silicon PV option with energy payback times reduced by more than 5 times. Innovative large area (250 mm sq.) cells from reclaimed wafers will be integrated with novel low-cost Concentrating Photovoltaic (CPV) modules operating at 10 to 20 suns (20 times normal sun intensity). This could yield up to 20 times more power than a standard PV module. The static module will use a novel sunlight trapping and focusing to maximise cell light capture and will avoid costly tracking and cooling systems. These modules could be used as remote off-grid power generation sources or for grid connected power.</p>
            
            <p>This project will develop new R&amp;D technology for sustainable energy generation in collaboration with advanced manufacturing companies in the local area.</p>

          <p>In engineering computational modelling using finite elements, finite difference or other numerical methods is routinely undertaken to get approximate solutions of complex engineering problems.

In order to predict the RCS computational simulations of different configurations are commonly undertaken to ensure that civilian vehicles are easily detected whilst military vehicles are not.</p>
            
            <p>This project will employ existing finite element software for performing simulations of RCS predictions for some simple configurations in 2D.</p>

          <p>Soil is important stuff, and soil hydrophobicity is an important environmental problem across large areas of agricultural soil. This project will examine how different hydrophobic and hydrophilic soils take up water from atmospheres of fixed humidities, and how this water uptake affects the water repellency of the soils. This experimental project is suitable for anyone with basic lab skills and the ability to analyse and interpret experimental data. Humidity will be controlled by saturate salt solutions; water analysis carried out using a Karl-Fischer auto titrator; and water repellency will be measured using water penetration time tests.</p>

          <p>Smart Metering in one of the government’s priority technologies in reducing the carbon emission until 2020, and an investment of around £4-7Bil is expected in this technology in the coming years. Automatic Meter Reading is the technology of automatically collecting data from a utility metering device and transferring that data to a central database for billing and/or analysis. This saves employee trips, and means that billing can be based on actual consumption rather than on an estimate based on previous use, giving customers better control of their consumption of the utility under consideration. They can tell people about their utility use through either linked display units or other ways, such as through the internet or television. Among other potential benefits, they could offer utility customers accurate bills and provide information that could help them use less energy and encourage energy efficiency.</p>
            
            <p>During this project, student will analyse data recorded by the smart electricity meter and design the colour graphic display to present the data in a way that would appeal to the costumers and inspire them to reduce their electric energy consumption.</p>

          <p>The project will explore rheometric approaches to the characterization of the linear stress relaxation modulus of biopolymer gel systems under a range of setting (‘quench’) temperatures using two principal experimental techniques. The first of these employs a true fixed strain test in a controlled displacement type instrument under which condition the shear stress is continuously monitored following the sudden imposition of an initial deformation within the linear regime. The second employs a similar approach implemented on a controlled stress instrument under pseudo controlled strain conditions. The project will seek to assess and optimize the ranges of validity of test parameters under which complementary results can be accurately obtained from both tests.</p>

          <p>In June 2011 parts of England were officially declared in a drought. Although this state of affairs did not last long, this situation shows our increasing susceptibility to water shortages and the vagaries of the weather. For example, England suffered its driest spring in a century, leaving fields parched and many rivers at record lows, whilst Scotland, by contrast, had its wettest spring on record for the three-month period of March, April and May 2011, showing the wide regional variation.</p>

          <p>In 2006-07 the House of Lords Science and Technical Committee in their report on Water Management, recommended that “the Government should consider additional funding to boost research into desalination in the United Kingdom”.

Indeed on the 2nd of June 2010, a new desalination plant was opened at Beckton.</p>
            
            <p>This project will look at the problems associated with the civil engineering of a desalination plant, such as site selection, layout, brine intake and disposal etc., with particular emphasis on building more plants in the UK.</p>

          Strength testing and uses of Pykrete
        </h4>

          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Pykrete is a composite material made of approximately 14 percent sawdust or some other form of wood pulp (such as paper) and 86 percent ice by weight. Its use was proposed during World War II by Geoffrey Pyke to the British Royal Navy as a candidate material for making a huge, unsinkable aircraft carrier. Pykrete has some interesting properties, notably its relatively slow melting rate (due to low thermal conductivity), and its vastly improved strength and toughness over unmodified (crystalline) ice, actually closer to concrete.</p>
            
            <p>This project will look at strength testing of Pykrete (made up of various compositions) to see if it practically would have any use as a building material in cold climates.</p>

          <p>For those that watch Mythbusters, there was an episode where they experimented in making a concrete glider. This project will aim at doing the same thing. The project will look at what defines a glider and how they are usually made. The project will then go on to look at various types of concrete which made be used for making a glider, followed by casting, building and testing methods for a small prototype.</p>

          <p>What is the best way to take a penalty kick at football? Is it best to pick a spot and stick to it? Change your mind in the run-up? Just blast it? Why do some clubs/countries excel at penalty shootouts, whilst others struggle? These are the major questions asked by most football fans (especially England fans) after their side has been knocked out of a competition.</p>
            
            <p>This project will look at the theories and statistics behind taking penalties and anlyse the best way in which to take a penalty kick to give the best result.</p>

          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Fragments of ancient Egyptian earthenware figurines of cobras have been found and there are suggestions that these may have been destroyed as part of ritual activity. It is also possible that they have been destroyed by natural and accidental processes. The question arises as to whether fragments arise from ritual activity or the latter. A previous project has examined the effects of dropping and crushing symmetrical items of consistent quality and has reported the statistical distributions arising from replicate tests. A batch of figurines has been commissioned to replicate those from ancient Egypt and these will have been produced in a manner typical of that likely to have been used in ancient Egypt (i.e. without the quality control of mass production). It is proposed that a series of dropping and crushing tests be performed on these asymmetrical objects. (No in-tact ancient figurines are available for the tests.) The project involves performing the tests and analyzing the outcomes in relation to the previous study. The aim is to determine whether the deliberate ritualistic destruction of such figurines is detectable.</p>

          <p>Computer models enable us to study the physiology of the lymphatic system in health and disease. Hence, in this project a time-dependent flow model (ODE) will be developed of the lymphatic system. This network consists of a set of self-contracting flexible tubes with valves in order to propel the fluid from the interstitial spaces of the tissues to the blood stream. After a literature review the student will develop the network model in matlab and investigate the physiology of 1 or more lymphangions.</p>

          <p>Vortex shedding is an important phenomena that can have disastrous effects on engineering structures (e.g.Takoma bridge). This project will focus on the simulation of vortex shedding behaviour using computer models.

          <p>The choices of low energy and low carbon lighting are ever-increasing, as is the need to switch to them from traditional incandescent lighting. Both Australia and the state of California have announced plans to ban their use, and the EU has begun to consider the idea.</p>
            
            <p>At present we predominately just replace one or two primary sources of light in a room with one or two equally bright sources, albeit ones which use less energy. Solid state lighting can be even more efficient still, but at present not at the highest intensities. To light a room, the number of light sources would need to be increased, which has implications for how buildings are designed and laid out, and how power is distributed. In these lower energy forms of lighting, much of the cost is associated with stepping the voltage down from the line voltage to that required in the light source. Would it be worth designing buildings that also have lower voltage power lines, with one central efficient regulator?</p>
            
            <p>This project will largely be a literature research project, looking in to the physical issues associated with designing buildings to use low-energy forms of lighting, weighing up the merits of different approaches, and suggesting changes to current building design practices which would enable designers to incorporate more energy efficient sources.</p>

          <p>The description of complex aircraft structures is inevitably associated with some amount of uncertainty in specifying mass. The uncertainty of mass arises from variable cargos and passengers which are generally not known precisely during the design. The aim of the project is (a) to quantify the effect of mass uncertainty on the vibration response of the system, and (b) to validate and update the numerical (finite element) model in the light of such uncertainties. Vibration analysis will be conducted on simplified structures (for example, a cantilever beam and plate). Uncertainty will be simulated using randomly placed lightweight spring-mass oscillators on these structures. Statistical analysis of the response will be compared against finite element models with uncertain parameters. This project will result enhanced understanding of uncertainty quantification and model validation essential for future generation of aircraft design.</p>

          <p>Aircraft, and in particular spacecraft, to be developed in the future will have various NEMS and MEMS devices for enhanced performance. The function of NEMS (nano electro mechanical systems) and MEMS (micro electro mechanical systems) devices require superior sensing capabilities. The current generation of sensors can only identify mass based on based on frequency shift. This project will generate new methods to detect rotary inertia of the system.</p>

          <p>The identification of tiny gas particles is important in many fields including aerospace, chemical and biological engineering. The increase of global terrorism requires the authorities to develop highly sensitive sensors to detect undesirable particles present in extremely low density. This project will develop the idea of vibration based mass sensors using two coupled nano-cantilever beams. The changes in the coupled vibration modes will be exploited to detect the mass of tiny gas particles attached to any of the nano-cantilever.</p>

          <p>Future generation of manufacturing will include self-assembly of systems. The idea is that different components or systems will attach to each other “on their own” and create larger systems. This project will consider the static, buckling and dynamic analysis of self-assembled one-dimensional systems and networks. Each subsystem will be modelled by Euler-Bernoulli beams. Given the properties of the individual systems, the properties of the self-assembled system will be derived. Finite element analysis will be used for this purpose.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Finite element stress analysis is an extremely powerful computation method for predicting displacements, stresses and strains in components and structures subject to tension, compression, bending, torsion, shear and pressure and, in many cases, combinations of two or more of these fundamental loading types.</p>
            
            <p>It is an approximate method and so the accuracy of the predictions depends, to a great extent, on the model. Stress concentrations can be produced by real effects such as holes, fillets etc. or unrealistic effects such as point loads. In the latter case, the predictions can be highly unrealistic and methods to take account of these high predicted stresses have been proposed.</p>
            
            <p>This numerical project will involve looking at a number of stress concentration features, using finite element analysis, and assessing the suitability of the proposed methods in ‘smoothing out’ the localised high stresses so that the predictions are more realistic.</p>

          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Finite element stress analysis is an extremely powerful computation method for predicting displacements, stresses and strains in components and structures subject to tension, compression, bending, torsion, shear and pressure and, in many cases, combinations of two or more of these fundamental loading types.</p>
            
            <p>It is an approximate method and so the accuracy of the predictions depends, to a great extent, on any simplifying assumptions that are made. Plane stress and plane strain assumptions are often used to reduce three-dimensional problems down to two-dimensional ones. Plane stress can be used when a relatively thin component is subjected to in-plane loads and plane strain when the component is relatively thick.</p>
            
            <p>This numerical project will involve looking at a number of examples and obtaining predictions using both of these simplifying assumptions and then comparing them with predictions for a full three-dimensional analysis. In this way, the suitability of these assumptions for particular cases can be assessed.</p>

          The effect of carbohydrate on post-exercise rehydration and recovery (4)

          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Current recommendations encourage athletes to drink at a rate that will prevent excessive dehydration (&gt;2% body mass) during exercise. Therefore, although individual drinking practices vary, most will finish a bout of exercise in a hypohydrated state. If repeated exercise sessions are scheduled on the same day or the fluid deficit is large, some athletes may fail to re-establish fluid balance and consequently this may, in some situations, be detrimental to performance.</p>
            
            <p>Post-exercise rehydration has been the focus of a number of studies. These previous investigations have typically focussed on the electrolyte (eg. sodium and potassium) content and volume of fluid consumed, but several recent studies have investigated the effects of carbohydrate. Drawing on some new and exciting research that has re-shaped our understanding of carbohydrate ingestion during exercise, this project will investigate the effect of different carbohydrate drinks on fluid and electrolyte balance following exercise in an attempt to determine if they could enhance the recovery process.</p>

          <p>The Micromouse group design exercise is a feature of the level two labs in Electrical and Electronic degree programmes. In session 2010/2011 a project student explored a new way of building a micromouse, using individual modules each with its own micro controller. This has many advantages if the project is to be tackled by a group. So far, three modules have been constructed: motor control, floor sensors, and RS-232 interface. Each has its own, low-cost micro controller.</p>
            
            <p>In this project, several new modules will be designed and built, including an infra-red module, and a servo module. These will be incorporated into the existing machine and appropriate embedded software must be written.</p>
            
            <p>Skills required: micro controller hardware and software, interface electronics.</p>

Parameters to be recorded are altitude and acceleration. Data storage will be on a non-volatile (flash) memory. Previous projects have resulted in the selection of suitable sensors for acceleration and altitude, and the subroutines required to communicate with the flash memory. A tiny version of the micro controller used in &#8220;micromouse&#8221; will form the basis of the data recorder.

          <p>All the Micromouse robots constructed over the last ten years have employed a motor plus gearbox supplied by Swallow Systems.

            <p>The student will be required to review the chassis designs used in recent micromice, and to find a suitable alternative motor. A &#8220;standard&#8221; chassis must be designed, to carry the motors, micro controller, batteries and so on. This will form the basis of the next generation of micromice.</p>

          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Gas sensors based on polycrystalline metal oxide semiconductors offer many advantages over current technologies for detecting reducing gases (H2, CO, CH4) , such as low cost, long lifetime and high sensitivity. The sensing mechanism is based on changes in conductivity of the sensing film induced by chemical reactions between target gases and oxygen species adsorbed onto the film surface. Sensors usually operate at elevated temperature to promote chemical reactions. Additionally, sensors made with nano-sized particles exhibit a much higher sensitivity compared with micron sized particles. In this project, sensing devices will be fabricated using ZnO nanostructures such as nanocrystals and nanowires. The project will involve measuring the conductivity response of the devices as a function of their temperature and gaseous environment (vacuum, air, inert atmosphere and target gases) using a Keithley pico-Ammeter. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) will also be used to characterise the nanoscale structure of the sensing device. SEM allows imaging down to a resolution of 1 nanometre.</p>

          <p>Biological systems often demonstrate highly advantageous characteristics, such as self healing, self organization, adaptation, and self learning. Researchers are seeking to apply lessons from biology to improve the design of communication networks. For example, ants are adept at finding the shortest routes to food, which might offer lessons for network routing protocols. The way that the human body heals itself and fights off infections may offer insights for self-healing and secure networks. The project will choose one notable example from biology and demonstrate how biology can lead to improvements in current network design or operation. The improvement should be demonstrated mathematically or by computer simulations.</p>

The placement of a company&#8217;s web page near the top of search results can mean a big difference in business. Companies use SEO (search engine optimization) techniques to increase their ranking in Google, but sometimes veer into &#8220;blackhat SEO&#8221; techniques that Google considers to be unethical. This project aims to (a) review the algorithms used by Google to rank web pages (b) review whitehat and blackhat SEO techniques (c) experimentally measure the use of blackhat SEO techniques on the web.</p>

            <p>Once built, the v-44 Albatross will be a world outright sailing speed record contender. The v-44 employs sub-cavitating foils comprising of a pair of keels, a rudder and a hydrofoil at the base of the rudder. The boat will demonstrate an upper speed limit, or velocity not to exceed, which is defined by the incipient cavitation speed of these foils. Since the challenge involves setting a new sailing speed record, the onset of foil cavitation must be delayed as far as practically possible.</p>
            
            <p>The objective of this project is to use computational methods (CFD and FEA)to understand the feasibility of designing and building a sub-cavitating keel with an incipient cavitation speed of approximately 70 knots, and to understand the likely performance and limitations of such a keel. The intention is not to produce a final detailed design.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Lead is a cumulative poison that affects the nervous system and can retard some aspects of child development (both size and intelligence). Lead pipes were used up to the 1980s both for connecting a property to the water supply main and for internal plumbing, due to lead&#8217;s strength, malleable nature and resistance to corrosion. In the UK, about 40% of properties are supplied via a lead pipe. Elsewhere in Europe, the estimated percentage of properties supplied by lead pipe-work varies from &lt; 5 to 50 per cent.</p>
            
            <p>Problems with sampling for determining compliance need to be more clearly understood and the specification of a harmonised sampling methodology by the European Commission is <a href='http://www.ciwem.org/knowledge-networks/panels/water-supply--quality/lead-in-drinking-water.aspx'>long over-due</a>.</p>
            
            <p>The aim of this project is to initially review the techniques used throughout the world to ascertain lead concentration in drinking water. The second part of the project will create a computational model that will allow comparison of the abilities of the techniques to predict compliance (using Matlab or other language the student is familiar with).</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Over the last 12 months the Welsh team has competed against many of the best teams in the world and lost. Whilst this is not necessarily a bad achievement the fact that in many of these matches the Welsh team had chances to achieve better results and let them slip is of slight concern. A more worrying trend is the performances against the weaker teams such as Italy and Fiji. These are teams that should have been easily beaten given the abilities shown against New Zealand and South Africa. In all matches the Welsh team seem to have a lack of belief in their ability to win the match and performed at a level that was close to that of the opposition. This is in stark contrast to the recent grand slam team which seemed to have a belief that far outstripped the team’s overall skill set.</p>
            
            <p>The underlying question of this project is how do you change the mindset of a team, rather than an individual, in order to stop them underperforming? As a sceptic about the ability of an external factor being able to affect a team’s performance can you scientifically demonstrate the benefit of your ideas to me?</p>

          <p>Throughout the water industry control of the flow of water is fundamental to many processes.

Additionally slow moving water in reservoirs may lead to algal plumes and the associated problems.</p>
            
            <p>The aim of this project is to review the methods used to ensure that the required water retention times are achieved and demonstrate the effectiveness of some of the techniques using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The review should cover a range of processes and compare and contrast the methods that can be used. CFD models should be constructed for a number of techniques. For each technique the model should provide an understanding of the design parameters that control the effectiveness of the technique.</p>

        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Geometrically-necessary dislocation (GND) content can be determined by the effect of dislocations on the lattice curvature of a crystal. Local orientations are measured using Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), which are then used to determine the local orientation gradients and resolved into the GND content. There is experimental evidence that GND content accumulates at grain boundaries during plastic deformation, the magnitude of which may be related to the geometry of the grain boundary. The objective of this project will be to determine any relationship between the GND content accumulated at a grain boundary and the grain boundary character in strained and annealed samples of copper. The student will use orientation data obtained using EBSD to create maps of GND content in the sample. The student will then use image analysis software to obtain plots of GND content as a function of distance from the boundary. Once a sufficient number of boundaries are measured in this manner, the data will be compiled according to the boundary geometry and character as well as the amount of induced strain. This project is also suitable for Materials or Mechanical students.</p>

          Carbon Nanotubes in Sports Equipments
        </h4>

          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Nanotechnology is being applied to many areas of sport, especially in the finding of novel materials to obtain better sport equipment performances. Carbon nanotubes have been incorporated in sport equipments for the past few years, particularly by companies such as Yonex, makers of badminton racquets. The remarkable mechanical properties exhibited by carbon nanotubes have simulated much interest in their use to reinforce advanced composites. Their elastic modules is over 1TPa and tensile strength is over 150 GPa which makes them many times stiffer and stronger than steel while being three to five times lighter. In promoting their products, several manufacturers of sports equipment have advertised carbon nanotubes as reinforcement of some of their top of the line products. The student will carry out literature review in this specific topic and investigate the different challenges of using carbon nanotubes in sports equipment development and manufacturing, and also what needs to be overcome before the carbon nanotubes can be widely used.</p>

          <p>Context-sensitive design represents a new way to plan projects in construction. It is an approach that ensures that projects are not only functional and cost-effective, which agreed with the traditional design approach, but are also in harmony with the natural, social and cultural environments. In this context, the student will be required to look into the guidelines and recommendations for housing professionals to meet or exceed energy efficiency requirements issued by the Energy Saving Trust. The student will also investigate in more detail the Beddington Zero Energy Development (BedZED) which is an environmentally friendly housing development in Hackbridge, London, England.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Literature review based project Water scarcity and water pollution are two increasingly pressing problems that could easily and quickly surpass the oil issue. Renewable energy sources can eventually substitute for fossil fuels but freshwater can’t be replaced. This makes the ability to remove toxic contaminants from aquatic environments rapidly, efficiently, and within reasonable costs a significant technological challenge. Nanotechnology could play an important role in this regard. The student will be required to investigate the latest advances in the development of novel nanomaterials with increased affinity, capacity, and selectivity for heavy metals and other contaminants and for the potential remediation of industrial wastewater, groundwater, surface water and drinking water. The student will also investigate the use of coated iron oxide nanoparticles as a sorbent material for removal of heavy metals from water (case study).</p>
