      <h1>List of Staff</h1>
      <p>
        Please note that this list is sorted by your email address. Thus c.p.jobling comes before s.g.r.bown. I could potentially do this smarter, but this is the easiest way to present the data that has been collected with the tools that I am using. Note that some projects are marked as unavailable. Clearly projects that are allocated are not available, but some projects may have become unavailable because of your loading. In such cases, projects could potentially be reassigned to colleagues in the second stage.

        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Due to their low density and good environmental stability Al-alloys are increasingly being considered as the preferred structural material replacing steel. This trend is likely to increase further in the automotive sector in order to reduce car weight, fuel consumption and achieve lower CO2 emissions. Despite their superior specific strength, Al-alloys have only been used in prestige cars due to the high processing cost and relatively lower strength. In order to achieve widespread Al usage in consumer vehicles, strength and cost reduction has become essential. Both mechanical strength and solid state processability (thus, reduced processing cost) can be improved by grain refinement. Although chemical grain refinement is now a standard industrial practice for Al, it has limitations such as unused inoculant particles severely reduce the fatigue performance (major concern for aerospace and automotive usage). Most importantly, chemical inoculation only works for a handful of alloys and is mostly ineffective in many commercially important Alloys. Current research has demonstrated that use of high-energy ultrasound during solidification can lead to dramatic microstructural refinement in a wide range of light alloys. This promising technology can lead to a physical grain refinement mechanism that can address the limitations of conventional techniques and lead to Al-alloys with better property, superior fatigue performance and universal applicability irrespective of alloy additions. In this work the effectiveness of high-intensity ultrasonic irradiation on grain refinement will be explored in various Al-alloys.</p>

          <p>Al-alloys are increasingly being used to replace steel in many structural applications due to their good corrosion performance and better specific strength. The use of Al-alloys is expected to increase significantly in automotive applications to reduce vehicle weight, fuel consumption, and CO2 emission. Throughout the UK and EU, Al-alloys are being used to completely replace galvanised-steel street and motorway lighting columns. Welding is used as the most common joining method for Al-parts. However, the heat-affected region created due to welding may render some of these joints susceptible to failure in demanding applications where high stress and environment factors play a decisive role. This is more critical in heat treatable high strength alloys where the strength loss due to welding may be prevalent in the heat affected zones and failure may occur due to stress, corrosion or a combination of both. The aim of the project is to investigate the structure, property and corrosion behaviour of welded joints from heat treatable aluminium-alloys. The effect of designed thermal treatments on improving the joint properties will be explored if time permits.</p>

          <p>Magnesium is the lightest of all structural material and a promising candidate for aerospace, automotive and other structural applications due to their high specific strength and stiffness, good damping properties, good electromagnetic shielding and ease of machining. Advanced Mg-alloys are now being used in helicopters and it is anticipated that proper alloy and process development will significantly increase the use of Mg-alloys in cars. Magnesium car can very effectively address the necessary fuel and emission reduction as required by the ever stringent environment legislations. Drawback of magnesium alloys are low absolute strength, poor corrosion performance and manufacturing cost too prohibitive for mass application in the automotive industry. Many alloys have been developed with improved corrosion property and can be manufactured cost effectively through high-speed die casting. However, majority of the cast alloys are not designed to be heat treated to improve strength, and show poor mechanical property following processing. A new and promising development to address the shortcoming of Mg processing is the development of semisolid processing routes that promise to significantly improve and refine the cast structure, eliminate defects and improve mechanical property of the components processed in near-net shape. Such development can significantly reduce the cost of processing and mechanical performance of Mg-components by combining elements from casting and solid state processing together.
            In the present work, a systematic study will be undertaken to investigate and compare the structure and property of advanced magnesium alloy processed through conventional HPDC and semisolid HPDC. Based on the results the relative strengths and shortcomings of the new technology will be evaluated.</p>

          <p>A prestressed membrane structure is a structural form which, due to its own geometrical shape, boundary conditions (supports) and prestressing loads, is subjected only to in-plane tensile forces, thus compressive/shear forces and bending/torsional moments are not present. Tensile membrane structures (possibly in combination with cable nets) are most often used as roofs as they can economically and attractively span large distances (i.e. the O2 Arena in London or the Olympic Stadium in Munich). Form-finding is the process by which an initial shape is obtained in equilibrium with the prestress pattern, prior to the application of in-service loads (i.e. snow, wind). In this project, various form-finding techniques will be investigated, in the context of cable-nets and tensile membranes, and comparisons will be drawn between them in terms of the resulting final shape.</p>

The project will then look at either i) the effect of polymer-solvent interactions on conformation or ii)  simulations of dynamics using either Monte Carlo of molecular dynamics techniques.</p>

          <p>There are many applications in Engineering were software is used in design or in fundamental research to establish the optimum conditions or optimum performance. When there are many possible variables and the software used in the modelling has a high computational demand, both in cpu and memory, then it is vital to have an optimisation strategy that minimises the number of tests that have to be run to establish optimised conditions or performance. This project will review such strategies and report their performance.</p>

This electricity could be stored locally and can be used for powering lights and displays, etc. The few possible options could be (a) Using a piezoelectric material underneath the road which converts electricity from the pressure of moving vehicles. (b) Using energy capturing mats at places where traffic needs to slow down. These mats will impede the vehicles and capture their power as electricity. (c) Use small wind turbines along motorway which convert the air thrust generated by fast moving vehicles to electricity.</p>

          <p>One of the issues that developers of marine energy devices have to tackle is the way in which the devices are fixed to one location. In the case of tidal stream turbines, the devices may be held in place by drilling and piling into the sea bed or through gravity foundations, but they must be able to withstand the high currents that are present in the deployment locations. Floating wave energy devices are generally moored to the sea-bed, but this has to be done in such a way that will ensure that the motion of the device with respect to the wave climate is not impeded. This project will involve investigating the issues associated with fixing either tidal stream or wave energy devices to their deployment location, and developing a set of rules that should be followed when determining the amount of anchorage required for a particular device.</p>

          <p>Extracting energy from the marine environment using tidal stream turbines is an area that is attracting a lot of interest currently. However, in order to reap the most benefit from this technology in the future it will be necessary to deploy farms/arrays of turbines. These arrays will need to be configured so that the optimum performance can be achieved across the array. Each turbine will remove some energy from the tidal stream so the performance will be dependent on the spacing between the turbines, both laterally and longitudinally. This project will involve optimising the configuration of an array of tidal stream turbines using previously obtained computational model data for a single turbine over a range of current speeds.</p>

Child booster seats are designed for children aged between 4 and 12, weight 15 kg to 36 kg. Some of these have high backs to add extra support for young children, and children are restrained in the seats using adult seat belts. However, a worrying problem with the booster seats can occur if a young child falls asleep in the car and slumps forward over the belt or to the side, almost sliding out of the belt. The aim of this project is to investigate ways in which this problem could be avoided whilst still satisfying safety legislation.</p>

          <p>Wastewater processing plays an essential role in modern industry. Design and construction of the hydraulic structure is fundamental to an efficient and effective processing procedure. This requires a clear understanding of the hydraulic flow and its influences to the concrete structure. Also, as a long-term structure and to provide a sustainable solution, the design and construction has to takes into consideration the impact on the surrounding environment.<br/>
            The wastewater hydraulic system consists of water tanks and networking pipes. The pipe flow is regularized and controlled by the hydraulic structure whose mechanical behavior is strongly influenced by the dynamic load from flowing water. The project mainly includes two parts:
            a) Analysis and optimization of pipe flows in the hydraulic system.
            b) Analysis and design of reinforced concrete tanks according to Eurocode.<br/>
            Dr. Mauricio Lobao from Black &amp; Veatch Ltd. (http://www.bv.com/) will be the industrial supervisor, and a few meetings in Black &amp; Veatch Ltd. (Swansea office) may be required.
            The student choosing this project is expected to have a clear understanding of concepts, principles and methods in fluid mechanics and structure mechanics. The project student will face an industry project and benefit from working with professional engineers.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>When the wind blows, a floating object will experience a drag force in the direction of the wind. As the object is induced to drift through the water it will experience a hydrodynamic drag force in the opposite direction. Equilibrium results when the wind-induced aerodynamic drag force is balanced by the hydrodynamic drag force. This occurs at the drift velocity. The ratio of the drift velocity to the wind velocity will depend upon the proportion of the object above and below the waterline.</p>
            
            <p>This project will deal specifically with the induced drift velocity for a floating human body. The work is required for forensic analysis in a criminal investigation. In the first stage, the project will take an experimental approach using the wind tunnel and the water tank available in the School and aim to provide a quick but rough estimation of the drift velocity. In the second stage, a computer simulation approach will be taken (using ANSYS CFX, a commercial computational fluid dynamics package) to confirm the experimental result and obtain more detailed prediction.</p>
            
            <p>The project student is expected to have good knowledge in fluid mechanics, strong ability in experimental investigation, and an interest and open mind of computer simulation.</p>

          <p>The wheelchair is an essential tool for immobile people who wish to travel indoors and out. A reliable wheelchair is essential for accessibility and confidence for the user, failure of the wheelchair frame could cause serious injury and discomfort for the user. A specific problem recognized with wheelchair failure is fatigue fracture in the cross-brace.  It is a problem common with manual folding frame wheelchairs. Fatigue failure causes the chair to be inoperable for the user and could cause serious injury depending on the consequences after the failure. In order to avoid critical failures in wheelchair frames, standards are set for manufacturers to follow, theses involve static strength tests and fatigue tests.</p>
            
            <p>This project will investigate the use of finite element analysis to predict the fatigue strength of a wheelchair frame. Due to the inconsistent nature of fatigue many factors are to be considered when assigning a fatigue strength property. The computer simulation will involve both both static and dynamic analysis. The commercial finite element analysis package “ANSYS” will be used as the main tool in the project.</p>
            
            <p>The project student is required to have solid knowledge in both mechanics and mathematics, with strong motivation to work with real engineering problems. From the project, the student will gain knowledge of using computer simulation to assist analysis and design of complicated engineering structures and receive training of combining techniques to solve real engineering challenges.</p>

One of his ideas is to develop a library of examples in Matlab and/or Mathematica that can be used to demonstrate important engineering principles in lectures and could serve as tutorial problems. Mechanical engineering is already a subject that is well served by such examples. The aim of this project would be survey the examples already available from the Mathworks and Wolfram and, with the help of lecture staff, identify new topics that can be illustrated in similar ways. It is expected that the student will also develop some demonstrations as well. Some example topics are signals and systems theory, control systems, statics and dynamics and system modelling and simulation. An important requirement will be the exploitation of the user interface features provided by Matlab and/or Mathematica to create easy to use and compelling simulations. The resulting library will need to be well documented, usable by both staff and students, and easy to extend in the future. Examples that can be delivered on mobile devices such as smart phones or table PCs will be of particular interest.

If you have sufficient interest, the project could be extended towards the development of a suitable exercise monitoring application of your own.</p>

          <p>In 2012 the UK will host the Olympics. It is likely that some athletes will use drugs to enhance their performance. Identifying athletes who take anabolic steroids to enhance their performance is problematic for analytical chemists. In recent years, advances in analytical equipment have enabled measurement of these substances. From this, the natural or synthetic origin of the steroid can be deduced, conclusively proving whether cheating has taken place.</p>
            
            <p>This project aims to critically analyse the recent literature findings on the recent analytical techniques used to detect steroids used by athletes, and in what ways steroid drug cheats are fighting back in order to prevent detection.</p>

We have seen the construction of desalination plant in London and Paris and we are all aware of the increasing demand and competition for water resources within many parts of the world. Desalination produces fresh water with a by product of concentrated brines that need to be dispossed of. This is often by discharge back in to the oceans. There are useful metal ions found in theses brines that could be recovered. Thus, the processing of brines could be economic and improve the environmental impact of desalination. The student project will examine the methods used to process the brines from the desalination plants. The project will also research the environmental impact and possible remediation methods to recover materials prior to disposal.</p>

The surface of a medical implant is the interface between the device and the human body, how the surfaces interact governs the efficiency of the devices operation. If the device operation involves the passage of an electrical current, the device must have an insulating coating. If the coating breaks down then the current leaks to the surrounding tissue, causing pain during the operating procedure. Thus we have established an experimental rig within the laboratories at Swansea which localises dye at the point where an insulating coating has been compromised. The student will survey the use of the implants and then improve the design of the experimental rig, followed by testing based on undamaged and damaged medical devices.</p>

          <p>A major problem for many medical implant devices is the formation of biofilms at the surface of the implant leading to a high degree of patient morbidity and mortality. When a medical implant is placed in the body it acts as a very attractive surface for bacteria to adhere to, where they have inproved survival and go on to form complex biofilms which are able to resist treatment with antibiotics. Thus, methods that control the build up of biofilm are of tremendous interest. The student will use hydrodynamic shear assays to assess the attachment of model mircroorganisms to implant biomaterials. Various techniques to control the biofilm will be explored.</p>

          <p>Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanotubes are newly fabricated nanomaterials which exhibit exceptional mechanical properties and unique piezoelectric properties. They are promising for a wide range of applications in nanotechnology, e.g., nanosensors, electroemchanical nano-resonators, electron emission devices and reinforcing fibers in super-strong nanocomposites. The vibration of ZnO nanotubes is one of the major concerns in nanomechanics and the design of ZnO nanotube-based NanoMechancialElectrical Systems. Particularly, the nanotubes usually oscillate under initial stresses generated by external gas pressure, mismatch between different materials, or initial external loadings. Such initial stresses will reduce the structural stiffness of the nanotubes and thus significantly change their vibration frequency and associated deformation patterns. As a result, the study of ZnO nanotube vibration with initial stress is of engineering and scientific interest. In this project, the cost–efficient continuum mechanics models will be used to describe the general vibrational behavior of ZnO nanotubes under axial force. The dependence of vibration frequency and associated deformation patterns on the initial stresses will be quantified for various vibration modes by considering the initial stress-induced decrease of the structural stiffness. The outcomes of this project will bring in an in-depth understanding of the effect of initial axial force on ZnO nanotube vibration and provide useful guidance for the design of ZnO nanotube-based nanodevices and nanoelectronics.</p>

          <p>Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanotubes are novel nanomaterials which exhibit exceptional mechanical properties and unique piezoelectric properties. They therefore have great potential to serve as fundamental elements in the 21st century nanotechnology. Their potential applications  include ultrahigh-frequency nano-resonators, electron emission devices and reinforcing fibers in super-strong nanocomposites. These nanotubules are usually of slender and thin structures and work under axial loads due to external gas pressure, mismatch between different materials, or initial external loadings. Such axial stresses will reduce the structural stiffness of ZnO nanotubes and lead to the instability of these nanostructures. Indeed structural instability or buckling of ZnO nanotubes is one of major failure modes, which substantially affects the load-carrying capacity of the nanotubes and may also alter their electrical properties greatly. It is thus of great interest to study the structural instability of axially compressed ZnO nanotubes. In this project the continuum mechanics models will be employed to explore the buckling behavior of ZnO nanotubes due to axial stress. In particular, the nonlocal elastic theory will be used to account for the small scale effect on the buckling of nanotubes and predict the critical buckling loads and associated deformation patterns for the ZnO nanotubes subject to pure axial load. The effect of nanotube size, e.g., radius, length and aspect ratio will be examined in details.</p>

          Dynamic Behavior of CNT-based Hybrid Nanowires

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>A new type of hybrid nanowires has been fabricated by coating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with functional nanocrystals. These nanomaterials exhibit exceptional properties, e.g., extreme stiffness, high strength and high electrical conductivity, and thus hold substantial promise for the reinforcing fibers in nanocomposites and the fundamental elements of nanoelectronics and nanodevices, such as ultrahigh-frequency resonators, electron emission devices, and chemical/mechanical sensors. Many of these applications depend crucially on the unique vibration behavior of the novel nanowires. On the other hand, the vibration of the nanowires could threaten structural integrity, impair performance and introduce positional uncertainty in nanostructures. Specifically, the vibration-induced deformation could result in an abrupt change in the electrical and optical properties of the nanowies, which in turn will significantly affect their proper functioning. Thus a thorough understanding of the dynamic behavior is essential for the design and application of the nanowires. Motivated by this idea we shall conduct a detailed study to capture the vibration behavior of the nanowires. To achieve this goal a new model and the mathematic strategy will be developed in the frame work of continuum mechanics to give a reliable description to the interaction between inner CNTs and coating layers. The major attention will be focused on the possible vibration modes, associated vibration frequency and the effect of geometric size (e.g., the inner radius of CNT and the thickness of coating layers) on the vibration of the nanowires. The outputs of the project will significantly advance the knowledge of the overall vibration behavior and deliver a cost-effective model for the novel hybrid nanowires comprising CNTs and various nanocrystals.</p>

          <p>Aluminum Nitride (AlN) nanowires are semiconducting piezoelectric nanomaterials, where applying mechanical load would generate electric voltage and result in the redistribution of electric charge. AlN nanowires thus are promising for the building blocks of the newly proposed nanopiezoelectronics, the smart nanodevices based on the combination of semiconducting and piezoelectric properties at nanoscale. Specifically, due to size reduction to nanometers AlN nanowires exhibit significant surface effect on their piezoelectric responses, i.e., the surface layer(s) will exert influence on the overall piezoelectric properties of the nanowires. Such an effect will lead to unique behaviors, which distinguishes piezoelectric nanostructures from their macroscopic counterparts. The potential applications and distinctive behaviors of  AlN nanowires provide impetus for a comprehensive study of their piezoelectric responses. In this project the new piezoelectric theory will be developed to capture the unique piezoelectric behavior of AlN nanowires due to the significant effect of surface piezoelectricity. This will allow us to accurately and efficiently characterize the general piezoelectric behavior of AlN nanowires and examine the effect of surface layer on the nano-piezoelectricity. The outcomes of the project will provide efficient modeling tools and a database for the future study of nano-piezoelectricity and the development of AlN-based nanopiezoelectronics.</p>

The project will entail developing an understanding into the effects of transferring conventional rigid glass based dye-sensitized solar cell technology onto flexible substrates and any photovoltaic losses. The project will involve the manufacture of rigid and flexible dye-sensitized solar cells on glass and titanium substrates and their characterisation with a particular interest on the substrate - TiO2 interface. This project will be embedded in the SPECIFIC centre within a larger activity aimed at developing energy generating functional coatings for the built environment.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Car manufacturers are increasingly using composite materials in an effort to reduce vehicle weight in order to improve fuel economy, CO2 emissions and the carbon footprint. Typically, structural composites have used synthetic reinforcements such as glass and carbon fibres or low cost fillers such as talc. In recent years, the use of natural fibres as a reinforcement has also gained applications as a lightweight and sustainable resource. Additionally, newly developed nanocomposites are starting to make inroads into the vehicle market. However, at the same time, legislation is forcing manufacturers to recycle all end-of-life vehicles, and composite materials in general are more difficult to recycle.
            This project should aim to review current usage of composites in vehicles including specific case studies and assessment of likely future trends. In addition to the technical aspects, the project might also consider the effects of environmental concerns and legislation.</p>

          <p>Large quantities of waste glass are currently generated in this country and a variety of applications are being sought. One potential low carbon application is using recycled glass as a heat sink and subsequently as a slow release heat source. It is believed that broken or imploded glass contained in a vessel could act to help stabilise temperatures in contained environments such as green houses and conservatories. It is felt that there could be potential in manufacturing and marketing this as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional heating mechanisms. The aim of the project is to assess the potential for such heat exchange mechanisms to provide small amounts of heating and cooling in contained environments.
            The project could address some of the following issues:
            • Heat uptake/release of different types/sizes/arrangements/colours of glass.
            • Effects of combining glass with different solid and/or liquid materials on heat uptake, retention and release properties.
            • The potential for heat exchange to warm airflows within contained environments.
            • Comparison of different system designs.
            • Practicalities of setting-up and designing an appropriate system.</p>

          <p>Composites are increasingly being used in structural applications where designers take advantage of their strength and stiffness combined with low density. These properties lend themselves to transport applications, such as the aerospace and automotive industries, where impact damage can be a problem. Another issue with polymer based composites is that they are subject to stress relaxation, that is, if held at a constant strain, the stress reduces with time. In this project it is planned to carry out an investigation into combined effects of impact and stress relaxation by damaging composite samples and then testing their subsequent mechanical properties. It is also hoped that from the results a model can be produced to describe the stress relaxation behaviour.</p>

          <p>Polymers subjected to a combination of stress and a hostile environment may exhibit Environmental Stress Cracking (ESC), depending on the precise conditions. The mechanisms of ESC are not fully understood, and probably vary from one combination of material and liquid to another. This project should aim to investigate these conditions concentrating on a limited combination of material and environments. It is planned to carry out experiments to investigate the effects of stress and environment individually by stressing samples prior to immersion in the environment and immersing other samples prior to application of the stress. This combination of experiments should help to throw light on our understanding of the mechanisms and the relative significance of stress/strain levels and environmental conditions.</p>

          <p>The aim of this project is to combine experimental, analytical and numerical techniques in
            modelling and simulation of the buckling behaviour of elastic columns and frame structures. In
            the first part of the project linear theory of column buckling will be reviewed and comparisons
            will be made with numerical results. Experiments will be performed to verify the theory. During
            the second part of the project a simple frame structure will be employed and linear buckling
            theory and numerical solution used in prediction of critical load. Results will be scrutinised
            by performing experiments.</p>
            
            <p>The project is viewed as an extension of the successful project completed previously. Numerical simulations will be performed by employing elementary numerical procedures, so that only a basic knowledge of numerical modelling is necessary.</p>

            <p>This project will look at sensory mechanisms involved in generation of neural signal.
            The research will focus on interaction between the finger pad and textured surfaces during
            pressing and sliding movement. For this purpose, finite element simulations will be used
            to extract the characteristic responses. The simulations will be performed in the

          <p>Processed food arrive at the food factory in plastic bags of varying size an content. Today the are emptied manually. This is very labour intensive and there is a wish to automate this. Target price is around 60000£. Several mature solutions is manufactured by European companies, but they are primarily aimed at "dry" bag content: grain, concrete, milk powder etc.
            The finished machine must be made from stainless steel, but can have plastic parts. It must be CE approved and live up to national legislation. The bags must be completely emptied. and no part of the bag can go into the food.</p>

          <p>The objective of this project is the development and coding of an optimisation-based algorithm for the determination of phreatic surfaces for soils subjected to seepage flow. The programming language adopted is MATLAB and the student will start from an existing finite element program for seepage flow analysis in 2-D. The resulting algorithm should produce quadratic rates of asymptotic convergence to the solution (the shape and position of the phreatic surface) which are well above that of simpler algorithms currently described in textbooks.</p>

This unique performance is introduced by the incorporation of small amounts of martensite in the primarily ferritic microstructure.

          <p>Description: Conventional structural steels require fire protection to achieve the required fire resistance, which in effect can cost as much as 50% of the steel price, The application of fire protection could extend the construction period of the building by several weeks, thus creating another cost penalty. Hence, a fire resistant steel that requires limited or no fire protection, could lead to cheaper and faster building construction.</p>
            
            <p>The aim of this project would be to control the design characteristics of novel fire resistant steels by assessing the effect of their grain size and the amount of alloying elements on improved fire resistant behaviour. Using the state of the art Gleeble 3500 unit the elevated temperature microstructures and mechanical properties would be also assessed under variable true strain regimes.
            Equilibrium precipitation sequences would be modelled via numerical/thermodynamic modelling software available within the Materials Research Centre and correlated to obtained microstructures characterised via No Optical and Scanning Electron Microscopy techniques.</p>

          <p>Description: TRIP (TRansformation with Induced Plasticity)  Strip steels are increasingly used in the automotive industry as crash barrier members. They offer enhanced protection due to their superb crash performance characteristics, permitting improvement in car safety. This enhanced performance is due to the intricate mix of a soft ductile ferrite matrix, with a critical hard martensite island dispersion.</p>
            
            <p>As part of this project, the processing route of 2 development grade TRIP steels will be optimised and their enhanced mechanical properties will be assessed via hardness and tensile property measurements.</p>
            
            <p>A correlation of the obtained mechanical properties with modified microstructures will be made, using advanced electron microscopy techniques with a view of quantifying the optimum mix of ferrite to martensite ratio for enhanced performance characteristics.</p>

          <p>Latent fingerprints on items of evidence in criminal investigations are typically visualised by the use of a developer, which increases the optical contrast between the fingerprint pattern and the background surface. Most routine print detection work is carried out using reagents such metal powders, various dyes and superglue. However, for metal surfaces it has been shown that an instrumental technique based on Volta potential mapping using a scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) generates superior results under certain circumstances. The principal aim of this work will be to determine whether or not SKP can visualise fingerprint patterns in instances where recovery of ridge pattern detail has not been satisfactory using various chemical developers. The sensitivity of SKP versus techniques such as superglue fuming and metal deposition will be determined using a fingerprint depletion series approach.</p>

          <p>In order to maintain a strategic advantage over foreign competitors in coated product technology, the UK steel industry is currently developing high performance organic coatings with minimal environmental impact. Thin organic coatings (TOCs) are presently being investigated as one-step alternatives to using costly combinations of pre-treatments, conversion coatings and organic polymer based primer layers which contain anti-corrosion pigments. TOCs are intended for use on steel prior to the application of a topcoat and must confer a level of corrosion protection equivalent to existing technologies. The aim of this project is to identify promising coating systems for use as TOCs at thicknesses of 5 microns or less, along with appropriate methods of application. The most promising candidates will be used to coat relevant metal substrates on a laboratory scale and will be assessed with respect to corrosion resistance using a combination of time-lapse photography and in-situ scanning Kelvin probe analysis. It should be noted that this work will be carried out within the SPECIFIC laboratories in Baglan and that the student should have his or her own transport.</p>

          <p>Producers of architectural steel cladding are continuing to develop products with added value, comprising coatings which have a function over and above that of simply protecting the underlying steel. One such product under current development is cladding steel coated with a photocatalytic layer, which can self-clean by harnessing solar energy to break-down dirt and grime. Potentially such technology could also be employed to purify rain-water falling on to the coated panel surface. The aim of this project is to review the current state of the art in self-cleaning coated materials for use in construction. A second aim will then be to design an industrial building which can efficiently utilize self-cleaning architectural steel panel and window technologies. The building should make optimum use of incident sunlight and comprise a system to re-circulate rain water which will have been purified by sustained contact with the self-cleaning layers.</p>

          <p>Hydrogen is currently perceived as the fuel of the future, offering zero carbon dioxide emission and few of the other pollution issues associated with the combustion of fossil fuels. In addition the plentiful source of raw material (water), coupled with the ready availability of many mature hydrogen-based engine, fuel cell and storage technologies make hydrogen fuel an attractive green option. Hydrogen is generated via the electrolysis of water, a process which must be carried out using renewable energy sources for the true benefits of hydrogen fuel to be realised. Since the early seventies, it has been known that solar energy can be used to split water into its constituents using titanium dioxide photo-catalytic electrodes. The aim of this project is to review all significant developments in the field of solar hydrogen generation since this initial breakthrough. In addition, a second component of the project will involve designing solar cell and associated storage facilities to enable the most promising technologies to be applied on a large scale.</p>

          <p>The practice of monitoring respiratory function during exercise is now well established as a training aid in sports science. Spirometry can be used to measure lung capacity, while measurement of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in inhaled/exhaled breath allows calculation of parameters such as peak oxygen uptake (VO2). However, there is increasing interest in monitoring other gases in human exhalations as a means of tracking sporting performance. For example, there is evidence to suggest that certain food supplements or types of diet aimed at sportspeople can lead to heightened levels of atypical species, such as nitric acid or aldehydes in exhaled breath. This project aims to review key developments in the field of in-line breath monitoring applied to sports science. There may also be scope to utilize a newly acquired nitric oxide breath analyser for a preliminary assessment of the exhalation of human subjects both prior to and following consumption of dietary supplements aimed at improved sports performance.</p>

          <p>A newly launched initiative between the colleges of medicine and engineering is looking at the effect of nanoparticles on the human immune system. There are two important reasons for undertaking such a study:  i. the increasing use of nanotechnology is raising many questions as to the safety of nanoscale particles and ii. many new medical diagnostic and treatment methods are based on the use of nanoparticles. In this project students will work alongside PhD and postdoctoral researchers looking at the effects of nanoparticles on the human immune system. Fluorescent, polymeric nanobeads will be used with primary blood samples from blood donors. Very little is known about the uptake of nanoparticles into white blood cells or of the influence of age, gender, health status on this. Using flow cytometry the project will quantify the dose of nanoparticles present in each of the important blood cell sub-groups – T-Cells, mononuclear cells, granulocytes and assess the degree of immune response triggered by the nanoparticles by studying cell signalling molecules. Detailed analysis of the data using statistical techniques will provide an insight to the cell-to-cell variability in nanoparticle uptake, the degree of correlation of dose with immune response and the links between cell-level biology and the whole person response.</p>

All of this is made possible by a natural cellular process - endocytosis, which is the primary route through which cells take up small particles and large molecules from their environment. This process has evolved to be most efficient for particles in the size range of 10-100 nm and so provides an intrinsic delivery route for nanomedicine. However, whilst much observation of nanoparticle uptake through endocytosis has been done there is still no clear understanding of the detailed processes at play and this limits our ability to predict the likely nanoparticle dose. In this project students will work alongside PhD students who are looking at data analysis of nanoparticle uptake into individual cells and developing computational models of the endocytic process.</p>

          <p>Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but has previously been geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for direct applications such as home heating. Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of conventional fossil fuels. As a result, it has been claimed that this technology has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed. The aim of the project is to investigate the claims made by the supporters of geothermal power, and evaluate whether or not it is a viable alternative energy source from a civil engineering perspective.</p>

          <p>All current spacecraft use chemical rockets for launch, though some have used air-breathing engines on their first stage. Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters for orbital station-keeping and some use momentum wheels for attitude control. Soviet bloc satellites have used electric propulsion for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north-south stationkeeping. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have experimentally used ion thrusters (a form of electric propulsion) to great success. The aim of this project is to investigate likely future developments in rocket (spacecraft) propulsion which will increase efficiency and hence the feasibility of projects such as manned interplanetary travel</p>

          <p>Corrosion resistant coatings based on hexavalent chromium have been commonly used to protect metal substrates in a wide variety of industries including the automotive, aerospace and construction sectors. Due to the carcinogenic nature of hexavalent chromium, legislation is currently being implemented to prevent its use, making the development of an effective alternative a vital priority. This project will concentrate on the development of new metallic alloy and organic anti-corrosion coating. Coatings produced will be characterised using SEM, and optical techniques to determine their structure. Corrosion performance of the new coating systems will then be determined using an array of scanning electrochemical techniques.</p>

            <ol>
            <li>Study literature on use of oscillators for prevent building vibration caused to wind blow or earthquake.</li>
            <li>Study the Euler-Bernoulli theory of beam vibration.</li>
            <li>Study of elasticity properties of typical high buildings.</li>
            <li>Prepare a code which allows computation of building vibration with accounting for additional oscillators.</li>
            <li>Find optimal parameters and locations of the oscillators.</li>
            </ol>
            
            
            <p>The project requires skills in data analysis, in physical modelling and in MATLAB programming.</p>

            <p>A simple model of kicking suggests that a heavier boot should produce a greater ball velocity. The student will use 100 Hz 2-D video to measure kicking with soccer boot and with attached masses of 200g, 400g, 600g and 800g. However, the ball velocity tends to remain constant because the extra mass produces a counteracting decrease in foot velocity. The student may need to look at the kicking mechanics to identify the mechanism for the decrease in foot velocity.</p>

They have a requirement to last a certain time and then break down under the action of UV from sunlight, which requires a detailed understanding of the effects of additives. This project is in collaboration with the world's largest supplier of tree shelters and a German University, where a large field trial is underway in Southern Germany. Samples from this trial are available for testing and analysis, and the results will lead to a much better control of the lifetime. The project is mainly experimental, using several techniques; samples taken at different times are available and more will come in during the project.</p>

Two important aspects will be examined in this project. Firstly how the distribution of fibres varies with lay-up in thick section composites. There is some evidence that some lay-ups have areas that are resin-rich which will make for easier liquid ingress. This part of the project will involve some detailed microscopy of thick composite samples and image analysis to assess the fibre distribution. In addition, the project will assess how new dynamic mechanical equipment can be used for in-situ measurements of the effects of liquid absorption.</p>

The aim of this project is to establish how competition times have changed with use of different suit designs. Quite a lot of this work will involve data gathering and analysis, for instance an analysis of competition times over recent years and correlation with the introduction of different materials. There may be some scope for some in-pool trials though this depends on availability of volunteers with different suits.</p>

          <p>In order to understand a player’s behaviour in a sport game, it would be essential to track player’s movement and analyze it. This requires positioning techniques for players. While there are various approaches and techniques for positioning, there are different and strict requirement for player’s positioning. As players should not have any impact on their performance from signalling devices that allow movement tracking, the weight of signalling devices should be light. This creates a number of challenging issues. In this project, the review of existing positioning techniques should be carried out first. Among existing techniques, a few candidates should be selected according to the requirements. Computer simulations should be built to understand their limitations and effectiveness in tracking player’s movement.</p>

          <p>A large percentage of steel is used in the construction industry and increasingly in the pre-painted form in structures such as the Millennium stadium in Cardiff, Supermarkets, DIY stores and large warehouses. Here the paint is applied by the steel maker and simply assembled onsite. These materials have long warranty periods of up to 40 years and failure generally occurs at the cut-edge of the material where metal is exposed and may corrode allowing the paint to peel off. To combat cut-edge corrosion the steels are coated with a zinc alloy and additions of corrosion inhibitors are made to the paint layers to retard corrosion. These inhibitors are critical and have traditionally been based on chromate systems. However, the chromium (VI) ions are carcinogenic and the use of such materials is being reduced through stringent legislation. Thus, steel companies are driven to find effective Chromate free systems that offer comparable corrosion resistance. This project will encompass a detailed literature survey of the current advances in chrome free technologies involving novel systems such as titanates, phosphates, ion exchange systems etc. to enable Tata steel to develop the coatings of the future.</p>

          <p>The development of renewable energy technologies is of critical importance for the future and thus much research is currently underway to produce energy through sources such as photovoltaic cells and wind. The issue with these technologies are that they are not consistent i.e. for photovoltaic materials electricity is only generated during the day, usually the lowest energy use period for a home. Thus, the energy generated must be stored and released when it is required and this must be achieved through batteries. This project supports the recent investment from EPSRC and industry of £20 million to fund the SPECIFIC research centre in Baglan Bay that is investigating such technologies. The project will encompass a detailed literature survey and evaluation of battery technologies that may be most suitable for the large area dye sensitised solar cells that are being developed within SPECIFIC. The project will also involve thoughts around the best methods and designs of incorporating batteries into steels roofs or roof spaces to maximise efficiencies.</p>

            <p>Currently, the data collected by the Floormap machine is analysed to extract information about each surface defect. The surfaces are not immediately visible to the eye and unfortunately one  task that has proved particularly difficult is to determine whether a given defect is on the top or on the bottom surface. This is important for subsequent repair strategy.   A patent for a new sensor configuration that is believed to enable  this top and bottom discrimination has been filed recently and this project is to investigate the associated signals to empirically  prove the top and bottom discrimination concept.  The work will be undertaken  with researchers at Silverwing who will provide the data to be analysed.  An enthusiasm for Matlab (or to learn!) is essential.</p>

          <p>This project relates to Solar PV electricity generation and the siting of the panels. Part one of the project is to analyse recorded data sets of solar PV generation from three local installations. The idea is estimate the optimum fixed position in order to maximise generation in the Swansea area. From this information it should then be possible to generalise for different locations, knowing the sun's trajectories through the year.</p>

          <p>Many measurements of competitive swimming are made by manual timings plus pool side pressure sensors. This project aims to assess performance measurements that could be possible from automatic analysis of video recordings. made from cameras in  fixed positions. An extension would be to link the video recordings to existing turn pressure senors to give timings at different stages. One benefit would be the automatic logging of times for each swimmer. The student would need to be enthusiastic in the context of computing and Matlab.</p>

Two obvious situations where the answer to this question might be useful are when the lifeguard numbers are to be checked and when water re-circulation rates are to be controlled. Through the analysis if a fixed camera, this project aims to perform video analysis to answer the question. An enthusiasm for Matlab is required.</p>

          <p>Trusses are widely used in aerospace, mechanical and civil engineering. Optimal design of these trusses can be done using performance criteria, such as stiffness, strength and weight. Although these are valid criteria, cost is becoming an increasingly important factor. Some of the cost is linearly linked to the weight of the structure. Other cost factors are more difficult to quantify. The aim of this project is to develop a cost model for trusses with an emphasis on manufacturing cost, and here by concentrating on the cost of manufacture of joints. The overall cost model is to be implemented in Matlab so that it can be used in in-house truss optimization programmes.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Most problems in structural optimization must be formulated as constrained problems. In a typical structural design problem the objective function is a fairly simple function of the design variables (e.g., weight), but the design has to satisfy a host of stress, displacement, buckling, and frequency constraints. These constraints are usually complex functions of the design variables available only from an analysis of a ﬁnite element model of the structure.
            The objective of this work is to explore the features of the Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser function and investigate the usability of this special function in optimization. The project will involve extensive programming in Matlab.</p>

There are several methods to interrogate a FBG sensor system. You will perform a literature review of the state-of-the-art and compare their advantages and drawbacks to practical implementation. A selected method will be implemented and tested in the laboratory.</p>

          <p>Silicon based power devices’ technology is reaching its maturity and is not able to deliver a further significant improvement in power conversion. The replacement by wide-bandgap III-Nitrides already demonstrating significant leaps in the performance of power devices is inevitable. The major current drawback issues preventing industrial fabrication are current collapse which reduces output power of the devices and device degradation affecting reliability into such degree that commercial exploitation is largely limited. Therefore, we would focus our project to tackle these two phenomena by i) investigating I-V characteristics of operation GaN HEMTs in order to gain physical understanding of mechanisms causing the current collapse and the device degradation, ii) build relevant physical models of the device using commercial tools (Silvaco).</p>

          <p>The accurate monitoring of electricity consumption is prerequisite for efficient and economic usage of electric power. The global quest for efficient and lower power consumption of modern society is widespread effort.
            In this project, we would like to contribute with our small bit and investigate how usage of young people in high education is govern. The main goal is to achieve the same as for rest of the population, efficient usage and minimum waste of electric power. This aim will also result in lowering of costs for electricity usage. On the other hand, this is very challenging task as the behaviour of university students is highly unpredictable, is expected to be with out significant pattern and might be accompanied by ignorance. The project will aim to identify this behaviour and patterns while also suggesting proper solutions.</p>

          <p>Intel announced one of the most revolutionary steps in mass transistor production by deciding to move from planar technology to non-planar technology (FinFETs) for 22 nm technology this year.
            Device simulations has to accompany the experimental effort since they are an effective approach to find solutions for these problems and have the advantages of being a faster and cheaper way. Since the transistors for future technology solutions will be fabricated using non-planar architecture and will become even smaller the quantum-mechanical transport simulations are required. Many TCAD software tools were developed throughout the years to accurately evaluate behaviour of the semiconductor devices. In this project, Silvaco’s 2D Non-Equilibrium Green's Function simulation tool is chosen to study and compared against experimental data.
            Aim of this project is to gain knowledge and capabilities of Silvaco’s simulation software. Therefore, we will investigate transport characteristic of silicon bulk semiconductor and a sub-22nm gate length Si Fin Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (FinFET). Silvaco’s ATLAS examples will be employed as a starting point. After gaining enough knowledge from testing Silvaco’s examples, we will move on to changing the input file to make comparison with experimental data.</p>

          <p>CMOS technology experienced a revolutionary change with the introduction of Hafnium-based high-κ dielectrics and metal gates by Intel at the 45 nm technology. Hafnium oxide remained at the 32 nm will remind at the 22 nm technology. Intensive academic and industry research demonstrates that beyond 22 nm CMOS technology, devices based on silicon channel will not be able to deliver the on-current prescribed by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. Radical changes need to be introduced in the device architecture and therefore Intel will start mass production in the 22 nm technology using a non-planar architecture. This has triggered also research in alternative, high-mobility materials like Ge for p-type MOSFET and III-Vs for n-type MOSFET motivated by a state-of-the-art predictive device modelling.
            In this project, we will upgrade the current Si bulk Monte Carlo code written in Fortran to be capable to simulate also III-V semiconductor materials. The update will build on the existing III-V bulk Monte Carlo code with simplified band structure which will allow for transfer of material parameters across. The new code will be evaluate against results from the existing III-V bulk Monte Carlo code and against experimental data.</p>

          High Temperature Deformation Characteristics of an Advanced Nickel Based Superalloy

          <p>Description: If the aerospace industry is to achieve its aim in reducing emissions and impact on the environment, the next generation of jet engines will need to burn fuel more efficiently and at higher temperatures. Building engine components capable of operating under such harsh environments is a technological challenge and while nickel based superalloys offer the heat resistance needed, they are difficult to join using conventional welding techniques. Rolls Royce are tackling this problem by applying inertia welding techniques to the production of compressor drums, turbine discs and shafts for jet engines. Inertia welding uses the heat generated by friction to fuse metal components together. A work piece is spun at high speed on a flywheel and brought into contact with a stationary component. Within seconds, the pieces reach forging temperature at the point of contact and are bonded together without melting or the addition of liquid metal. Rolls Royce are developing a model to simulate this process in the rotor disc alloy, RR1000 in order to optimize the welding process both in terms of structural integrity and to predict/ minimize residual stresses. In order for the model to make accurate predictions, mechanical property data is required as an input, in particular flow stress information obtained from forging tests.
            The project will involve data analysis for a range of temperatures and strain rates and the development of a curve fitting/ interpolation program. This program should be able to predict the flow stress for a given temperature and strain rate. Ideally the fitting routine should utilise a phenomenological deformation model. Material characterization will also form part of the analysis in order to define failure mechanisms and material stability within the defined test parameters.</p>

          <p>Description:
            The latest generation of nickel based superalloys must offer improved temperature capabilty to aero-engine and land based energy turbine manufacturers in order to improve plant effeciency and meet increasingly stringent envronmental regulations. Due to the combination of alloy metallurgy and extreme operational conditions, such alloys are prone to high temperature oxidation and sulphidation damage that can potentially compromise subsequent mechanical performance.</p>
            
            <p>This short project will characterise surface damage incurred during normal service operation in turbine disc components supplied by Rolls-Royce. As operating conditions (especially temperature) are pushed beyond previously defined design limits, instances of high temperature corrosion are becoming more regular. However, to date the scientific understanding of such damage remains extremely limited. An assessment of ex-service parts is now considered essential since fatigue cracks could initiate from sites of surface corrosion, acting as localised stress raising features (e.g. oxidised grain boundaries and surface inclusions, sulphidation pitting etc). Thus, the project will have direct engineering implications together with academic interest. The project objectives can be summarised as:
            1. Detect instances of surface oxidation / sulphidation in ex-service turbine components
            2. Characterise typical forms of high temperature corrosion damage
            3. Create an imaging database to archive instances of such damage
            4. Define physical corrosion metrics (corroded area, pit depths etc)
            5. Consider the potential implications for mechanical performance (fatigue and creep)</p>

          <p>Industry in general is faced with substantial challenges in the field of structural metals if it is to secure future sustainable growth.  In order to meet demanding performance and environmental targets a considerable drive to improve upon conventional metallic alloys will be necessary. It is widely considered that improvements to traditional materials via composition optimization alone have been exhausted , therefore, future engineering designs are likely to incorporate innovative processing techniques and ‘hybrid’ components employing dissimilar combinations of two or more alloy variants. Key to achieving this will be the development of novel joining technologies.
            The capability to join a metal to itself or to a different alloy greatly increases flexibility in design, production and repair when compared with traditional processing routes such as casting or forging and consequently, a wide variety of different joining techniques have been developed. Solid state welding techniques, such as linear friction welding are receiving considerable interest within the aerospace industry in the joining of advanced alloy systems, where these alloys are only joinable via such friction weld based processes</p>
            
            <p>This project will underpin the development of friction welding methods and process models for friction welding of titanium, nickel and steel alloys. The work will develop and understand a small scale disc bend test method, in order to characterize the mechanical properties of development linear friction welds. Carry out a range of tests to build up a database of results to ensure validity of the method and its relevant equations. The technique will be particularly effective when looking into weld simulations on φ10mm cylindrical rods, where the heat/cool treated zone is of a small thickness. Exploration of different heat profiles with the aim to establish effects on microstructure, properties and in turn optimising the process.</p>

          <p>Torsion in beams generally arises from the action of shear loads whose point of application does not coincide with the shear centre of the beam section. Codes of Practice require torsional stresses be checked and provided for in design. For general beams, exact solutions of torsion problems normally do not exist and approximate, numerical, methods of analysis must be employed.
              In this project, we will consider a beams of rectangular cross section, and begin by obtaining an exact solution via a separation of variables method. This will enable us to determine the value of the torsional rigidity of the beam.
               We will then solve the same problem using MATLAB and a basic finite difference method. The accuracy of the approximation will be demonstrated by comparing the computed and exact values of the torsional rigidity.
              To finish, we will use a higher order finite difference method and demonstrate its improved accuracy characteristics.</p>

          <p>Piezoelectric bimorph structures have been widely used in many industrial applications, such as vibration based energy harvesting devices, ultrasonic transducers, actuators, and speakers. In this project, the students are required to grasp knowledge of basic transduction mechanism of piezoelectric bi-morph structures by conducting multi-physical simulations using both the analytical and finite-element methods.</p>

          <p>According to Maxwell equations, varying magnetic field generates electrical charges, which is the theoretical foundation of the Electromagnetic energy Harvesting Devices (EHD). The basic mechanical element in the EHDs is the spring-mass system. In this project, the aim is to create dynamic model for the spring-mass system based on second order differential equations. In particular, air damping in the system will be taken into consideration.</p>

          <p>Since the early 1950’s minimill technologies have diffused to become part of the current steel making climate. For example, the share of electric arc steel production in total world crude steel production has risen steadily from the lows of 15% in 1970 to around 35% in 2002. This trend has had profound implications for the structure of the steel industry around the world. The continuation of this trend will also have significant implications for iron ore and coking coal demand in the longer term.</p>
            
            <p>In this project you will research the reasons for this growth in electric arc steel manufacturing and assess the implication for the future of the large integrated plant.

          <p>When designing materials for high temperature service, the design criteria for long term operation must guarantee that creep deformation should not cause excessive distortion over the planned service life and that creep failure should not occur within such a required operating life. Such creep fracture represents an obvious 'life limiting' design consideration as fracture of pipe work or other major components used by nuclear powered electricity generating plants could prove catastrophic. For this reason, studying their ability to predict the time to rupture strain has been the major criteria used to assess creep extrapolation techniques.
            One of the major steels used in pipe work in power generation plants is 1Cr-1Mo-0.25V. This project will compare the accuracy of the new “Wilshire” equations with some more traditional parametric techniques in predicting the life of these steels.</p>

          <p>Tube hydro forming has already proved successful in sub frame and chassis applications. Due to the fact that standard tube making methods are restricted to production of tubes with a diameter to thickness ratio of 65:1, when 100:1 is required, there has been limited uptake of this technology. However, the Corus tubular blank process allows a greater diameter to thickness ratio and so has more potential for wide spread use in Chassis applications. The major technical issue concerned with the manufacture of Corus tubular blanks is the effect of material elastic recovery (measured through springback) after forming has taken place.</p>
            
            <p>This project will develop a Fuzzy Neural Network model (the so called ANFIS architecture) for springback prediction and in the process identify the important design and process variables associated with springback.  The predictions from the model will then be compared to those obtained using existing predictive models. Finally, The finished Fuzzy Neural Network will be used to find settings for the process variables that help minimise elastic recovery.</p>

          <p>The use of bladed discs has the potential to eliminate complex aerofoil attachment arrangements that can result in a substantial reduction in weight. For this project you will be presented with the results from a systematic study of the effect of process variables on the mechanical properties of friction welded Ti-64 aero engine blades. The objective of the project will then be to build a Fuzzy Neural Network model (the so called ANFIS architecture) model of this friction welding process. This will be compared to the results obtained using a response surface methodology. From these models you will seek those manufacturing conditions that maximise the degree of upset in the finished welds and minimise the variability in upset around this maximum.</p>

          <p>This project will compare and contrast the predictions of various continuum models for flow in substrata of glaciers. A principal aspect of this study will be to investigate the variation of the onset of yield stress and its influence on material system response through generalized Herschel-Bulkley modelling; including shear thinning/thickening behaviour. Alternative modeling approaches shall include viscoplastic (yield stress), viscoelastic and visco-elasto-plastic (yield stress and memory) idealisations. The work will contain a literature review, and introduce front-tracking and slip boundary conditions.</p>

          <p>A variety of designs have been suggested for morphing wings, including compliant ribs, span extension and morphing winglets. These concepts usually require a skin that is flexible, so that the wing can deform, and stiff to withstand the aerodynamic loads. One option to satisfy these conflicting requirements is to employ skins with anisotropic properties, such as corrugated skins or stiffened elastomer skins. This project will consider the design of an elastomer skin to cover a honeycomb wing structure. The direction on the project will, to some extent, be dictated by the interests and background of the student, but is likely to include modelling of the skin deformation and actuator force requirements, the design of suitable skins for typical applications and/or manufacturing and testing stiffened elastomer skins.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>This project is based on the design, analysis and testing of a small aircraft wing that uses smart materials to change the shape of the control surfaces. Students will design several different geometries of smart material based composite wings. The smart material based wings will be compared to ones that have servo-motor based conventional control surfaces. An advanced wind tunnel force, moment and displacement measurement setup and an automated data acquisition setup (NI hardware, LabView) will be available for the project. Some working models and the wind tunnel setup can be viewed in the wind tunnel lab in Talbot Building. Please contact Prof Friswell or Dr Onur Bilgen (o.bilgen@swansea.ac.uk) to arrange a lab tour. No aircraft background required, however students should be comfortable with design and analysis software (Matlab, Ansys, Solid Works, other CAD packages, LabView, etc.), simple electrical circuits (resistors, capacitors, simple wiring, etc.), fabrication techniques (bonding, vacuum bagging, manual fabrication, etc.) and have an exceptional work ethic.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Aircraft wings are a compromise that allows the aircraft to fly at a range of flight conditions, but the performance at each condition is sub-optimal. Morphing allows a wing to change its geometry during flight to reduce the design compromises required. Although many concepts have been researched few have entered surface, partly because of certification issues, but also because the benefits of the morphing aircraft have not been demonstrated. This project will consider one of the morphing concepts (for example variable camber, span extension, variable twist, morphing winglets) and a common mission profile (for example UAV surveillance, long range endurance, commercial short/medium/long haul) and investigate the advantages and disadvantages of morphing aircraft by comparing the performance to the optimum conventional solution.</p>

          <p>Central blood pressure is a more accurate indicator of the blood pressure (BP) developed by the heart, peripheral BP measurement being a relatively poor surrogate of this value. Central BP can be estimated non-invasively from arm cuff BP using the pulse wave ‘augmentation index’ (AI). This study will use a newly developed device (the MobilOGraph) to assess the central BP and AI responses to physical exercise in healthy males and females.</p>

          <p>Modern medicine has access to many and varied imaging systems providing high resolution data from cell to whole body. These systems are often automated and so generate vast amounts of information which must then be analysed. The trend to ever greater data capture has led to the ‘data problem’ – too much information for human being to analyse; one way around this is to automate the analysis as well as the acquisition of images. In this project students will use a number of matlab-based software routines for the automated recognition and analysis of cells within optical microscopy and electron microscopy images. The issues to be addressed include:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Automated detection and counting of cells within tumour cell populations</li>
            <li>The automated counting of nanoparticle dose within cells</li>

          <p>The hexagonal close packed nature of the alpha phase titanium lattice leads to the development of a strong crystallographic texture within a number of titanium alloys. This may lead to anisotropic mechanical properties which require full evaluation prior to implementation in engineering applications. Currently there is much focus on the development of ‘macrozones’, areas of common crystallographic orientation which may have a further detrimental effect on mechanical properties.
            The student will be required to work alongside existing researchers in analysing material behaviour from a number of different microstructural titanium variants. The ultimate aim of the project is the development of understanding of the behaviour of these macrozones, which would lead to an overall improvement in properties which could be beneficial to the aerospace and other sectors.</p>

          <p>The recently developed Wilshire equations have shown great promise in the creep lifing of a number of different alloys, particularly in the prediction of long term creep behavior based on short term predictions. However, the creep lifing requirements for the aerospace sector differ significantly from the long term nature of the power industry. More important here is the accurate prediction of times to particular strains. Based on these results it has been shown that it is possible to regenerate full creep curves based on limited data.
            Clearly the Wilshire equations offer exciting new opportunities for the field of creep research. The role of the student in this project will be to work alongside existing researchers in further developing the Wilshire equations for use in the aerospace sector.</p>

          <p>In the production of new alloys for engineering applications at high temperature, creep lifing is extremely important. Premature failures can have catastrophic consequences that under some circumstances can involve expensive application shut downs, or even potentially loss of life. As such, a number of predictive techniques can be applied to predict long term creep lives based only on short term data, thus saving on protracted and expensive testing programmes. The current project seeks to evaluate these methods for modern power plant steels, including the most up to date revisions made to the recently devised ‘Wilshire equations’.</p>

Water hardness is mainly caused by the presence of the cations calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) and is partially due to aluminium, iron, and other divalent and trivalent cations. Hardness is considered to be an economical disadvantage as it increases soap consumption and fuel costs. A number of techniques are available for water softening. This project is targeted for students with good background in chemistry. The student is expected to critically review these techniques, analyse water in Swansea  and come up with a suitable technique for  softening.</p>

The biosensor consists of a molecule attached to the SiNW surface, which is capable of interacting selectively with a specific target biomarker. This binding event between the charged biomarker and the bioreceptor produces a change in the charge density at the nanochannel / nanowire surface, that can be detected as a change in the electrical behaviour of the sensor device (essentially, a depletion of the nanochannel resulting in a change in the channel resistance).</p>

The timing of the PhD studentships will coincide with the installation of the new £600k equipment and the studentships will be an ideal way to generate early momentum and ensure that the facilities have dedicated users who are trained by the equipment manufacturers and will generate
            immediate outputs for CNH.</p>

          <p>This project will develop novel production technology for low-cost Concentrator PV (CPV) using reclaimed silicon wafers from the semiconductor industry with low-cost concentrator lenses.</p>
            
            <p>Low-cost photovoltaics (PV) will be the major sustainable, clean energy solution for future energy demands. Silicon dominates PV technology (80% PV market share) and PV technology roadmaps predict that silicon cells will continue to be the primary source of solar power.</p>
            
            <p>Following the new government Feed-in Tariff (FIT) scheme, introduced to promote uptake of renewable electricity generation technologies, the demand for solar power is booming.</p>
            
            <p>Standard silicon cells have good efficiencies but require high energy inputs during manufacturing. Silicon wafers, reclaimed from the semiconductor industry (ideal for PV cells), do not require any thermal processing. Recycled wafers thus represent the greenest possible silicon PV option with energy payback times reduced by more than 5 times. Innovative large area (250 mm sq.) cells from reclaimed wafers will be integrated with novel low-cost Concentrating Photovoltaic (CPV) modules operating at 10 to 20 suns (20 times normal sun intensity). This could yield up to 20 times more power than a standard PV module.

          <p>The development of miniaturised integrated systems for detection of disease biomarkers, at clinically relevant concentrations in biological samples, and drug delivery for application in early diagnosis, monitoring  and treatment of diseases.
            “Bio-chip” sensors, developed using semiconductor devices combined with micro-fluidics will enable detection of biomarkers at ultra-low concentrations.
            This project will develop an integrated biosensor and drug delivery system. The sensor will be based on a “bioreceptor”-functionalised silicon nanowire (SiNW) capable of detecting biomarkers in blood, urine or even breath. The biosensor consists of a molecule attached to the SiNW surface, which is capable of interacting selectively with a specific target biomarker. This binding event between the charged biomarker and the bioreceptor produces a change in the charge density at the nanochannel / nanowire surface, that can be detected as a change in the electrical behaviour of the sensor device (essentially, a depletion of the nanochannel resulting in a change in the channel resistance).</p>

          <p>A drug delivery system consisting of a micro-pump, drug reservoir, microfluidics channels and an array of hollow microneedles will be developed. The project objective is to investigate the viability of onstant real-time feedback from a sensor to a drug delivery device.
            This integrated system will enable frequent and regular injection of the therapeutic agent via transdermal microneedles to achieve the optimum therapeutic dose for the patient.
            The microfluidics and microneedles will be fabricated using new CNH deep-etch and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) tools. The new CNH fabrication facilities have been targeted specifically for this type of research and the project would be one of the first to utilise the photolithography, EBL, etch &amp; deposition, surface and electrical characterisation tools at the CNH. The timing of the PhD studentships will coincide with the installation of the new £600k equipment and the studentships will be an ideal way to generate early momentum and ensure that the facilities have dedicated users who are trained by the equipment manufacturers and will generate immediate outputs for CNH.
            The studentship would also coincides with the EPSRC Grand Challenge in Nanohealth, which would directly allocate substantial funds for materials, consumables, investigator time and running costs for the project. Manpower for the development of the microfluidics/microneedles systems is essential in order to achieve the Grand Challenge objectives.
            This project has massive scope for collaboration with industry and integrated research technologies. For instance, the integrated biosensor / microfluidics system will eventually be used in a portable, hand-held, real-time diagnosis or monitoring system.
            This is a multidisciplinary Nanohealth project.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>This project will develop novel production technology for low-cost Concentrator PV (CPV) using reclaimed silicon wafers from the semiconductor industry with low-cost concentrator lenses.
            Low-cost photovoltaics (PV) will be the major sustainable, clean energy solution for future energy demands. Silicon dominates PV technology (80% PV market share) and PV technology roadmaps predict that silicon cells will continue to be the primary source of solar power.
            Following the new government Feed-in Tariff (FIT) scheme, introduced to promote uptake of renewable electricity generation technologies, the demand for solar power is booming.
            Standard silicon cells have good efficiencies but require high energy inputs during manufacturing. Silicon wafers, reclaimed from the semiconductor industry (ideal for PV cells), do not require any thermal processing. Recycled wafers thus represent the greenest possible silicon PV option with energy payback times reduced by more than 5 times. Innovative large area (250 mm sq.) cells from reclaimed wafers will be integrated with novel low-cost Concentrating Photovoltaic (CPV) modules operating at 10 to 20 suns (20 times normal sun intensity). This could yield up to 20 times more power than a standard PV module. The static module will use a novel sunlight trapping and focusing to maximise cell light capture and will avoid costly tracking and cooling systems. These modules could be used as remote off-grid power generation sources or for grid connected power.
            This project will develop new R&amp;D technology for sustainable energy generation in collaboration with advanced manufacturing companies in the local area.</p>

          <p>Soil is important stuff, and soil hydrophobicity is an important environmental problem across large areas of agricultural soil.  This project will examine how different hydrophobic and hydrophilic soils take up water from atmospheres of fixed humidities, and how this water uptake affects the water repellency of the soils.
            This experimental project is suitable for anyone with basic lab skills and the ability to analyse and interpret experimental data.  Humidity will be controlled by saturate salt solutions; water analysis carried out using a Karl-Fischer auto titrator; and water repellency will be measured using water penetration time tests.</p>

          <p>Smart Metering in one of the government’s priority technologies in reducing the carbon emission until 2020, and an investment of around £4-7Bil is expected in this technology in the coming years. Automatic Meter Reading is the technology of automatically collecting data from a utility metering device and transferring that data to a central database for billing and/or analysis.  This saves employee trips, and means that billing can be based on actual consumption rather than on an estimate based on previous use, giving customers better control of their consumption of the utility under consideration.  They can tell people about their utility use through either linked display units or other ways, such as through the internet or television.  Among other potential benefits, they could offer utility customers accurate bills and provide information that could help them use less energy and encourage energy efficiency.</p>
            
            <p>During this project, student will analyse data recorded by the smart electricity meter and design the colour graphic display to present the data in a way that would appeal to the costumers and inspire them to reduce their electric energy consumption.</p>

This project will design such a TCAS system to be used in pre-defined environments such as on motorways or in the urban streets. The key step in designing TCAS systems is to predict the cars movements and share such information among the nearby cars. This information is then evaluted by TCAS systems in the cars in order to decide whether the collision is imminent, and if yes, some corrective action to avoid the collision is suggested to the driver, or, possibly, the car actuator systems may even automatically initiate the collision avoiding corrective action.</p>

          <p>Various types of physiological signals can be collected to determine the human object functioning and performance. Such measurements are often distorted by measurement noises which negatively affects interpretation and evaluation of these signals. In this project, the student will consider digital signal pre-processing techniques that can be used to suppress the measurement noises for a selected class of physiological signals. The noise suppression pre-processing would be then normally followed by feature extraction and classification algorithms to test various hypothesis about the human object under consideration. These post-processing algorithms can be also considered in the project depending on the student's interest.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The project will explore rheometric approaches to the characterization of the linear stress relaxation modulus of biopolymer gel systems under a range of setting (‘quench’) temperatures using two principal experimental techniques. The first of these employs a true fixed strain test in a controlled displacement type instrument under which condition the shear stress is continuously monitored following the sudden imposition of an initial deformation within the linear regime. The second employs a similar approach implemented on a controlled stress instrument under pseudo controlled strain conditions. The project will seek to assess and optimize the ranges of validity of test parameters under which complementary results can be accurately obtained from both tests.</p>

          <p>This project is part of our wider collaboration with colleagues at the Bristol Heart Institute working on stem cell therapies for heart disease. At Swansea we are using novel, image-based cytometry to visualise many thousands of blood cells from bone marrow extraction and so detect the small fractions of stem cells present. This is part of a strategy to improve our understanding and identification of stem cells in order to direct the differentiation process that drives regeneration and hence thearapeutic results. The student will be involved in the image analysis and corresponding development of mathematical models of stem cell biology at Swansea; they will also interact with the Bristol team and have the opportunity to see first-hand the work at Bristol in the medical application of stem cell technologies.</p>

          <p>In June 2011 parts of England were officially declared in a drought. Although this state of affairs did not last long, this situation shows our increasing susceptibility to water shortages and the vagaries of the weather. For example, England suffered its driest spring in a century, leaving fields parched and many rivers at record lows, whilst Scotland, by contrast, had its wettest spring on record for the three-month period of March, April and May 2011, showing the wide regional variation.</p>

          <p>Pykrete is a composite material made of approximately 14 percent sawdust or some other form of wood pulp (such as paper) and 86 percent ice by weight. Its use was proposed during World War II by Geoffrey Pyke to the British Royal Navy as a candidate material for making a huge, unsinkable aircraft carrier. Pykrete has some interesting properties, notably its relatively slow melting rate (due to low thermal conductivity), and its vastly improved strength and toughness over unmodified (crystalline) ice, actually closer to concrete.</p>

            <p>This project will look at the theories and statistics behind taking penalties and anlyse the best way in which to take a penalty kick to give the best result.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>A family of multivariate representations is introduced to capture the input–output relationships of high- dimensional physical systems with many input variables. A systematic mapping procedure between the inputs and outputs is prescribed to reveal the hierarchy of correlations amongst the input variables. It is argued that for most well-defined physical systems, only relatively low-order correlations of the input variables are expected to have an impact upon the output. Correlated function expansion (CFE) utilize this property to present an exact hierarchical representation of the physical system. At each new level of CFE, higher-order correlated effects of the input variables are introduced. This methodology has been widely employed in many applications such as uncertainly propagation, design optimization, and response prediction. But so far the literature related to its application in structural damage identification (SDI) is scarce. Therefore this study attempts to present a systematic SDI procedure comprising four sequential steps of feature selection, parameter screening, primary meta-modeling and updating, and reference-state meta-modeling with SDI realization. The last two steps imply the implementation of inverse problems by model updating in which the meta-models substitute the FE models.</p>

          <p>This project proposes the response surface method for finite element model updating. The response surface method is implemented by approximating the finite element model surface response equation by adaptive high dimensional model representation (HDMR). The updated parameters of the finite element model were calculated using genetic algorithm by optimizing the surface response equation. The proposed method will then be compared with the existing methods that use simulated annealing or genetic algorithm together with a full finite element model for finite element model updating. The proposed method will be tested on an aircraft wing structure. It is anticipated that the proposed method will provide the updated natural frequencies and mode shapes that were of the same order of accuracy as those given by simulated annealing and genetic algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed approach would provide an efficient computational tool compared with the genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>This project aims to perform an atomistic simulation of fracture of copper symmetric tilt grain boundary. A parallel molecular dynamics code, LAMMPS, will be used to calculate stresses at the grain boundary as the strain of the bicrystal is incrementally increased. Matlab will be used to plot a stress-strain curve, and Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) will be used to visualize the simulation.</p>
            
            <p>This molecular dynamics simulation calculates the stress-strain relationship of copper symmetric tilt grain boundary under fracture. The grain boundary structure in this case is a &lt;100&gt; Σ5(210) symmetric tilt grain boundary.. The simulation cell is defined such that the bicrystal is pulled in the y-direction, or perpendicular to the boundary interface, to increase strain. The strain in increased for a specified number of times in a loop, and the stress is calculated at each point before the simulation loops.</p>

          <p>What is it that materials scientists do? We can look back in time and investigate how and why things have failed. Utilising cutting-edge technology and materials expertise to unravel the complex histories of materials. These can be aircraft failure investigations, corrosion of structures, or even the historical processes that resulted in the damage of ancient relics.</p>
            
            <p>This research, collaborating with Egyptology at Swansea on a high-profile project, will be the first of its kind, forging an exciting new avenue of materials research.</p>
            
            <p>The project will take replicas of eqyptian ceramic relics and devise methods of fracturing them that mimic ways in which they may have been broken in ancient Egypt. The resulting fracture surfaces will then be investigated utilising both conventional and scanning electron microscopy to determine the failure mechanisms and relate those to historical artefacts.</p>

          <p>Materials science has applications to numerous and diverse fields of research. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a bridging technology to many of these areas of research. CT can be used to investigate internal structures non-destructively; an extremely valuable tool when it's critical that a specimen remains intact.</p>
            
            <p>This research forms part of the first collaborative project between the Materials Research Centre and the Glaciology group at Swansea. The project will utilise offshore sediment cores recovered from the seabed around the Antarctic Ice Sheet. CT analysis of these samples will allow investigation of deformational structures such as fractures within the sediment body along with porosity and grain density and orientation.</p>
            
            <p>The stability of the marine West Antarctic Ice Sheet is of considerable interest to scientists and policy-makers, on account of climate change and potential for fluctuation in global sea level resulting from changes in ice sheet volume.</p>

          <p>Parallel and Distributed Computing (supercomputing) is at the heart of many innovations and discoveries in science and engineering today. It is about using multiple computational resources (e.g. multiple CPUs or computers), efficiently and simultaneously, to solve large problems which cannot be solved on a single unit. Computational machines, including personal computers, are becoming increasingly distributed and therefore parallel computing skills are of vial interest in academic and commercial organizations. The aim of this project is to design a simple demonstration of parallel computing techniques. Student could design an optical or wireless network simulator, or a road traffic simulator, or the student could develop a supercomputing implementation of well-known engineering methods such as finite element methods or Markovian modeling or solution of linear equation systems; it will be left to the background, strengths and interests of the student. The student is expected to have strong computational skills and interests.</p>

          <p>Computer models enable us to study the physiology of the lymphatic system in health and disease. Hence, in this project a time-dependent flow model (ODE) will be developed of the lymphatic system. This network consists of a set of self-contracting flexible tubes with valves in order to propel the fluid from the interstitial spaces of the tissues to the blood stream. After a literature review the student will develop the network model in matlab and investigate the physiology of 1 or more lymphangions.</p>

          <p>Vortex shedding is an important phenomena that can have disastrous effects on engineering structures (e.g.Takoma bridge). This project will focus on the simulation of vortex shedding behaviour using computer models. The student will design a model for vortex shedding behind one or more cylinders and investigate the interactions between them. A better understanding of vortex shedding can stimulate engineers to exploit this phenomena (e.g. energy harvesting) rather than fear it.</p>

          <p>Matlab can use the graphics card in a computer to run computations, rather than the usual central processor.  In wider computational mathematics, people are switching to arrays of graphics cards to solve large parallel problems.  This project will investigate using such a system inside Matlab, and look specifically at the effect on solving differential equations.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The choices of low energy and low carbon lighting are ever-increasing, as is the need to switch to them from traditional incandescent lighting.  Both Australia and the state of California have announced plans to ban their use, and the EU has begun to consider the idea.</p>
            
            <p>At present we predominately just replace one or two primary sources of light in a room with one or two equally bright sources, albeit ones which use less energy.  Solid state lighting can be even more efficient still, but at present not at the highest intensities.  To light a room, the number of light sources would need to be increased, which has implications for how buildings are designed and laid out, and how power is distributed.  In these lower energy forms of lighting, much of the cost is associated with stepping the voltage down from the line voltage to that required in the light source.  Would it be worth designing buildings that also have lower voltage power lines, with one central efficient regulator?</p>
            
            <p>This project will largely be a literature research project, looking in to the physical issues associated with designing buildings to use low-energy forms of lighting, weighing up the merits of different approaches, and suggesting changes to current building design practices which would enable designers to incorporate more energy efficient sources.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The description of complex aircraft structures is inevitably associated with some amount of uncertainty in specifying mass. The uncertainty of mass arises from variable cargos and passengers which are generally not known precisely during the design. The aim of the project is (a) to quantify the effect of mass uncertainty on the vibration response of the system, and (b) to validate and update the numerical (finite element) model in the light of such uncertainties. Vibration analysis will be conducted on simplified structures (for example, a cantilever beam and plate). Uncertainty will be simulated using randomly placed lightweight spring-mass oscillators on these structures. Statistical analysis of the response will be compared against finite element models with uncertain parameters. This project will result enhanced understanding of uncertainty quantification and model validation essential for future generation of aircraft design.</p>

The increase of global terrorism requires the authorities to develop highly sensitive sensors to detect undesirable particles present in extremely low density.

The changes in the coupled vibration modes will be exploited to detect the mass of tiny gas particles attached to any of the nano-cantilever.</p>

          <p>Current recommendations encourage athletes to drink at a rate that will prevent excessive dehydration (>2% body mass) during exercise.

          <p>The Micromouse group design exercise is a feature of the level two labs in Electrical and Electronic degree programmes. In session 2010/2011 a project student explored a new way of building a micromouse, using individual modules each with its own micro controller. This has many advantages if the project is to be tackled by a group.
            So far, three modules have been constructed: motor control, floor sensors, and RS-232 interface. Each has its own, low-cost micro controller.</p>
            
            <p>In this project, several new modules will be designed and built, including an infra-red module, and a servo module. These will be incorporated into the existing machine and appropriate embedded software must be written.</p>
            
            <p>Skills required: micro controller hardware and software, interface electronics.</p>

          <p>The object is to design and build a smalll module which can be carried by the model rockets constructed by Dr. Clee and his students. Parameters to be recorded are altitude and acceleration. Data storage will be on a non-volatile (flash) memory.
            Previous projects have resulted in the selection of suitable sensors for acceleration and altitude, and the subroutines required to communicate with the flash memory. A tiny version of the micro controller used in "micromouse" will form the basis of the data recorder. The finished item must be physically small and light, otherwise the rocket will never leave the ground!</p>

          <p>All the Micromouse robots constructed over the last ten years have employed a motor plus gearbox supplied by Swallow Systems. This company can no longer build the motors, because of supply problems and in addition their injection moulding machine has expired. A new "breed" of micromice is needed, using an alternative motor plus gearbox.</p>
            
            <p>The student will be required to review the chassis designs used in recent micromice, and to find a suitable alternative motor. A "standard" chassis must be designed, to carry the motors, micro controller, batteries and so on. This will form the basis of the next generation of micromice.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Gas sensors based on polycrystalline metal oxide semiconductors offer many advantages over current technologies for detecting reducing gases (H2, CO, CH4) , such as low cost, long lifetime and high sensitivity. The sensing mechanism is based on changes in conductivity of the sensing film induced by chemical reactions between target gases and oxygen species adsorbed onto the film surface. Sensors usually operate at elevated temperature to promote chemical reactions. Additionally, sensors made with nano-sized particles exhibit a much higher sensitivity compared with micron sized particles.
            In this project, sensing devices will be fabricated using ZnO  nanostructures such as nanocrystals and nanowires. The project will involve measuring the conductivity response of the devices as a function of their temperature and gaseous environment (vacuum, air, inert atmosphere and target gases) using a Keithley pico-Ammeter. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) will also be used to characterise the nanoscale structure of the sensing device. SEM allows imaging down to a resolution of  1 nanometre.</p>

Because of their small size, they have novel and exciting properties that can be harnessed into these nano-devices, with potential applications in many areas such as gas sensing, bio-sensing, nanomedicine, electronics and optoelectronics.
            During this project, the student will use a UV LED to excite electrons into nanowire devices and measure the resulting current using a Keithley pico Ammeter</p>

          <p>Biological systems often demonstrate highly advantageous characteristics, such as self healing, self organization, adaptation, and self learning. Researchers are seeking to apply lessons from biology to improve the design of communication networks. For example, ants are adept at finding the shortest routes to food, which might offer lessons for network routing protocols. The way that the human body heals itself and fights off infections may offer insights for self-healing and secure networks. The project will choose one notable example from biology and demonstrate how biology can lead to improvements in current network design or operation. The improvement should be demonstrated mathematically or by computer simulations.</p>

            <p>Once built, the v-44 Albatross will be a world outright sailing speed record contender. The v-44 employs sub-cavitating foils comprising of a pair of keels, a rudder and a hydrofoil at the base of the rudder. The boat will demonstrate an upper speed limit, or velocity not to exceed, which is defined by the incipient cavitation speed of these foils. Since the challenge involves setting a new sailing speed record, the onset of foil cavitation must be delayed as far as practically possible.</p>
            
            <p>The objective of this project is to use computational methods (CFD and FEA)to understand the feasibility of designing and building a sub-cavitating keel with an incipient cavitation speed of approximately 70 knots, and to understand the likely performance and limitations of such a keel. The intention is not to produce a final detailed design.</p>

          <p>Lead is a cumulative poison that affects the nervous system and can retard some aspects of child development (both size and intelligence).  Lead pipes were used up to the 1980s both for connecting a property to the water supply main and for internal plumbing, due to lead's strength, malleable nature and resistance to corrosion. In the UK, about 40% of properties are supplied via a lead pipe. Elsewhere in Europe, the estimated percentage of properties supplied by lead pipe-work varies from &lt; 5 to 50 per cent.</p>
            
            <p>Problems with sampling for determining compliance need to be more clearly understood and the specification of a harmonised sampling methodology by the European Commission is <a href="http://www.ciwem.org/knowledge-networks/panels/water-supply--quality/lead-in-drinking-water.aspx">long over-due</a>.</p>
            
            <p>The aim of this project is to initially review the techniques used throughout the world to ascertain lead concentration in drinking water.

          <p>Over the last 12 months the Welsh team has competed against many of the best teams in the world and lost. Whilst this is not necessarily a bad achievement the fact that in many of these matches the Welsh team had chances to achieve better results and let them slip is of slight concern. A more worrying trend is the performances against the weaker teams such as Italy and Fiji. These are teams that should have been easily beaten given the abilities shown against New Zealand and South Africa. In all matches the Welsh team seem to have a lack of belief in their ability to win the match and performed at a level that was close to that of the opposition. This is in stark contrast to the recent grand slam team which seemed to have a belief that far outstripped the team’s overall skill set.</p>
            
            <p>The underlying question of this project is how do you change the mindset of a team, rather than an individual, in order to stop them underperforming? As a sceptic about the ability of an external factor being able to affect a team’s performance can you scientifically demonstrate the benefit of your ideas to me?</p>

          <p>Geometrically-necessary dislocation (GND) content can be determined by the effect of dislocations on the lattice curvature of a crystal. Local orientations are measured using Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), which are then used to determine the local orientation gradients and resolved into the GND content. There is experimental evidence that GND content accumulates at grain boundaries during plastic deformation, the magnitude of which may be related to the geometry of the grain boundary. The objective of this project will be to determine any relationship between the GND content accumulated at a grain boundary and the grain boundary character in strained and annealed samples of copper. The student will use orientation data obtained using EBSD to create maps of GND content in the sample. The student will then use image analysis software to obtain plots of GND content as a function of distance from the boundary. Once a sufficient number of boundaries are measured in this manner, the data will be compiled according to the boundary geometry and character as well as the amount of induced strain. This project is also suitable for Materials or Mechanical students.</p>

          <p>Specimens are available from an ancient bronze sickle. Electron backscatter diffraction and other scanning electron microscope techniques will be used to characterise the microstructure of the parent phase and second phases, notably copper sulphide. Microhardness testing will also be used alongside the microstructure determination, to gain a view of how the sickle may have been made. Some samples may also be heat treated to examine the effect on the microstructure.</p>

        </p>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Nanotechnology is being applied to many areas of sport, especially in the finding of novel materials to obtain better sport equipment performances. Carbon nanotubes have been incorporated in sport equipments for the past few years, particularly by companies such as Yonex, makers of badminton racquets. The remarkable mechanical properties exhibited by carbon nanotubes have simulated much interest in their use to reinforce advanced composites. Their elastic modules is over 1TPa and tensile strength is over 150 GPa which makes them many times stiffer and stronger than steel while being three to five times lighter. In promoting their products, several manufacturers of sports equipment have advertised carbon nanotubes as reinforcement of some of their top of the line products. The student will carry out literature review in this specific topic and investigate the different challenges of using carbon nanotubes in sports equipment development and manufacturing, and also what needs to be overcome before the carbon nanotubes can be widely used.</p>

          <p>Social psychology research on doping and outcome based evaluation of primary anti-doping prevention and intervention programmes have been dominated by self-reports. Having confidence in the validity and reliability of such data is vital. The student will be required to investigate how both self-reports on behaviour and social cognitive measures could be affected by some form of response bias.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Context-sensitive design represents a new way to plan projects in construction. It is an approach that ensures that projects are not only functional and cost-effective, which agreed with the traditional design approach, but are also in harmony with the natural, social and cultural environments. In this context, the student will be required to look into the guidelines and recommendations for housing professionals to meet or exceed energy efficiency requirements issued by the Energy Saving Trust. The student will also investigate in more detail the Beddington Zero Energy Development (BedZED) which is an environmentally friendly housing development in Hackbridge, London, England.</p>

          <p>Literature review based project
            Water scarcity and water pollution are two increasingly pressing problems that could easily and quickly surpass the oil issue. Renewable energy sources can eventually substitute for fossil fuels but freshwater can’t be replaced. This makes the ability to remove toxic contaminants from aquatic environments rapidly, efficiently, and within reasonable costs a significant technological challenge. Nanotechnology could play an important role in this regard. The student will be required to investigate the latest advances in the development of novel nanomaterials with increased affinity, capacity, and selectivity for heavy metals and other contaminants and for the potential remediation of industrial wastewater, groundwater, surface water and drinking water. The student will also investigate the use of coated iron oxide nanoparticles as a sorbent material for removal of heavy metals from water (case study).</p>
