          <p>Capacitive sensors are devices that convert measurands into changes of capacitance. Usually initial capacitance or delta capacitance is very small, which are normally in the scale of pF.

          <p>C-fec (www.c-fec.com) have been developing a vertical axis wind turbine for the last four years. Whilst the principle motivation is to generate green electricity a concept has emerged where a version of the device could be used in the third world as a direct drive for an irregation system or for water recovery. The simplicity of the device and its ease of maintenance offer potential advantages in this context. The question remains whether such an idea would be economically viable.</p>
            
            <p>As part of this project it would be expected to investigate some or all of the following topics:
            • A review of the existing systems
            • Other options for water pumping
            • Commercial viability

          <p>Fibre Bragg grating (FBG) based optical sensors have become widely known and popular because they are immune to electromagnetic radiation, multiplexing capability, high durability, light weight and easy to embed in the composites, therefore they can be used for different sensing applications. There are several methods to interrogate a FBG sensor system. You will perform a literature review of the state-of-the-art and compare their advantages and drawbacks to practical implementation. A selected method will be implemented and tested in the laboratory.</p>

          <p>The use of child car seats is regulated by law for all children under 12 years or below 135 cm. Child booster seats are designed for children aged between 4 and 12, weight 15 kg to 36 kg. Some of these have high backs to add extra support for young children, and children are restrained in the seats using adult seat belts. However, a worrying problem with the booster seats can occur if a young child falls asleep in the car and slumps forward over the belt or to the side, almost sliding out of the belt. The aim of this project is to investigate ways in which this problem could be avoided whilst still satisfying safety legislation.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The development of renewable energy technologies is of critical importance for the future and thus much research is currently underway to produce energy through sources such as photovoltaic cells and wind. The issue with these technologies are that they are not consistent i.e. for photovoltaic materials electricity is only generated during the day, usually the lowest energy use period for a home. Thus, the energy generated must be stored and released when it is required and this must be achieved through batteries. This project supports the recent investment from EPSRC and industry of £20 million to fund the SPECIFIC research centre in Baglan Bay that is investigating such technologies. The project will encompass a detailed literature survey and evaluation of battery technologies that may be most suitable for the large area dye sensitised solar cells that are being developed within SPECIFIC. The project will also involve thoughts around the best methods and designs of incorporating batteries into steels roofs or roof spaces to maximise efficiencies.</p>

          Description
        </h3>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Finite element stress analysis is an extremely powerful computation method for predicting displacements, stresses and strains in components and structures subject to tension, compression, bending, torsion, shear and pressure and, in many cases, combinations of two or more of these fundamental loading types.</p>
            
            <p>It is an approximate method and so the accuracy of the predictions depends, to a great extent, on any simplifying assumptions that are made. Plane stress and plane strain assumptions are often used to reduce three-dimensional problems down to two-dimensional ones. Plane stress can be used when a relatively thin component is subjected to in-plane loads and plane strain when the component is relatively thick.</p>
            
            <p>This numerical project will involve looking at a number of examples and obtaining predictions using both of these simplifying assumptions and then comparing them with predictions for a full three-dimensional analysis. In this way, the suitability of these assumptions for particular cases can be assessed.</p>

          <p>Description: Conventional structural steels require fire protection to achieve the required fire resistance, which in effect can cost as much as 50% of the steel price, The application of fire protection could extend the construction period of the building by several weeks, thus creating another cost penalty. Hence, a fire resistant steel that requires limited or no fire protection, could lead to cheaper and faster building construction.</p>
            
            <p>The aim of this project would be to control the design characteristics of novel fire resistant steels by assessing the effect of their grain size and the amount of alloying elements on improved fire resistant behaviour. Using the state of the art Gleeble 3500 unit the elevated temperature microstructures and mechanical properties would be also assessed under variable true strain regimes.
            Equilibrium precipitation sequences would be modelled via numerical/thermodynamic modelling software available within the Materials Research Centre and correlated to obtained microstructures characterised via No Optical and Scanning Electron Microscopy techniques.</p>
