        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The widespread use of mobile phones creates opportunities for collection of various data about the environment. Thus, every mobile phone can be equipped with one or more sensors to obtain measurements from its immediate surroundings. For example, such measurements allow to map the local weather (barometric pressure, temperate and air humidity) or monitor the air quality. This student project will specify new applications that exploit data provided by different kind of sensors in the mobile phones. The specification will consider the associated signal processing in the data fusion centres and also take into account practical design constraints such as the cost of the sensors, the selective geographical and time availability of measurements, varying accuracy and reliability of the measurements, possible privacy issues, increased energy consumption in the mobile phones etc.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The student should develop a program (Matlab) to simulate a diode-pumped laser system. Experimental data will be provided for the student to validate the program.
            The project output should be a set of simulation in order to provide optimization of laser for environmental applications (e.g. wind detection and pollution detection).
            This will enable climate change monitoring.
            Matlab skills are requested as well as basic math. Writing skills would be a plus since data could be used for a publication on leading international journals.</p>

In session 2010/2011 a project student explored a new way of building a micromouse, using individual modules each with its own micro controller. This has many advantages if the project is to be tackled by a group.
            So far, three modules have been constructed: motor control, floor sensors, and RS-232 interface. Each has its own, low-cost micro controller.</p>

          <p>Due to the rapid advancement in wireless technology and the popularity of portable devices, there has been a growing interest in location awareness services. The wireless network infrastructure can be used as the basis for an indoor positioning system and it has become a viable option, with the prevalence of wireless hotspots and wireless area networks. In this project, we investigate location tracking and navigation algorithms for indoor mobile devices based on the received signal strengths from three or more Wi-Fi access points, from which we calculate the distances from the access points and then obtain the location of the device. The simulation platform based on OMNeT++/INET will be provided to a student as a starting point.</p>

            <p>This project will develop an integrated biosensor and drug delivery system. The sensor will be based on a “bioreceptor”-functionalised silicon nanowire (SiNW) capable of detecting biomarkers in blood, urine or even breath. The biosensor consists of a molecule attached to the SiNW surface, which is capable of interacting selectively with a specific target biomarker. This binding event between the charged biomarker and the bioreceptor produces a change in the charge density at the nanochannel / nanowire surface, that can be detected as a change in the electrical behaviour of the sensor device (essentially, a depletion of the nanochannel resulting in a change in the channel resistance).</p>

        </h3>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Gas sensors based on polycrystalline metal oxide semiconductors offer many advantages over current technologies for detecting reducing gases (H2, CO, CH4) , such as low cost, long lifetime and high sensitivity. The sensing mechanism is based on changes in conductivity of the sensing film induced by chemical reactions between target gases and oxygen species adsorbed onto the film surface. Sensors usually operate at elevated temperature to promote chemical reactions. Additionally, sensors made with nano-sized particles exhibit a much higher sensitivity compared with micron sized particles.
            In this project, sensing devices will be fabricated using ZnO  nanostructures such as nanocrystals and nanowires. The project will involve measuring the conductivity response of the devices as a function of their temperature and gaseous environment (vacuum, air, inert atmosphere and target gases) using a Keithley pico-Ammeter. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) will also be used to characterise the nanoscale structure of the sensing device. SEM allows imaging down to a resolution of  1 nanometre.</p>

          <p>A local company (<a href="http://www.silverwinguk.com/">www.silverwinguk.com</a>) designs and manufactures industrial inspection equipment. One of the products known as Floormap  moves over large areas of steel plates floors scanning for defects.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, the data collected by the Floormap machine is analysed to extract information about each surface defect. The surfaces are not immediately visible to the eye and unfortunately one  task that has proved particularly difficult is to determine whether a given defect is on the top or on the bottom surface. This is important for subsequent repair strategy.   A patent for a new sensor configuration that is believed to enable  this top and bottom discrimination has been filed recently and this project is to investigate the associated signals to empirically  prove the top and bottom discrimination concept.  The work will be undertaken  with researchers at Silverwing who will provide the data to be analysed.  An enthusiasm for Matlab (or to learn!) is essential.</p>

          <p>Many measurements of competitive swimming are made by manual timings plus pool side pressure sensors. This project aims to assess performance measurements that could be possible from automatic analysis of video recordings. made from cameras in  fixed positions. An extension would be to link the video recordings to existing turn pressure senors to give timings at different stages. One benefit would be the automatic logging of times for each swimmer. The student would need to be enthusiastic in the context of computing and Matlab.</p>

          <p>Silicon based power devices’ technology is reaching its maturity and is not able to deliver a further significant improvement in power conversion. The replacement by wide-bandgap III-Nitrides already demonstrating significant leaps in the performance of power devices is inevitable. The major current drawback issues preventing industrial fabrication are current collapse which reduces output power of the devices and device degradation affecting reliability into such degree that commercial exploitation is largely limited. Therefore, we would focus our project to tackle these two phenomena by i) investigating I-V characteristics of operation GaN HEMTs in order to gain physical understanding of mechanisms causing the current collapse and the device degradation, ii) build relevant physical models of the device using commercial tools (Silvaco).</p>

          <p>CMOS technology experienced a revolutionary change with the introduction of Hafnium-based high-κ dielectrics and metal gates by Intel at the 45 nm technology. Hafnium oxide remained at the 32 nm will remind at the 22 nm technology. Intensive academic and industry research demonstrates that beyond 22 nm CMOS technology, devices based on silicon channel will not be able to deliver the on-current prescribed by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. Radical changes need to be introduced in the device architecture and therefore Intel will start mass production in the 22 nm technology using a non-planar architecture. This has triggered also research in alternative, high-mobility materials like Ge for p-type MOSFET and III-Vs for n-type MOSFET motivated by a state-of-the-art predictive device modelling.
            In this project, we will upgrade the current Si bulk Monte Carlo code written in Fortran to be capable to simulate also III-V semiconductor materials. The update will build on the existing III-V bulk Monte Carlo code with simplified band structure which will allow for transfer of material parameters across. The new code will be evaluate against results from the existing III-V bulk Monte Carlo code and against experimental data.</p>

          <p>The development of miniaturised integrated systems for detection of disease biomarkers, at clinically relevant concentrations in biological samples, and drug delivery for application in early diagnosis, monitoring  and treatment of diseases.
            “Bio-chip” sensors, developed using semiconductor devices combined with micro-fluidics will enable detection of biomarkers at ultra-low concentrations.
            This project will develop an integrated biosensor and drug delivery system. The sensor will be based on a “bioreceptor”-functionalised silicon nanowire (SiNW) capable of detecting biomarkers in blood, urine or even breath. The biosensor consists of a molecule attached to the SiNW surface, which is capable of interacting selectively with a specific target biomarker. This binding event between the charged biomarker and the bioreceptor produces a change in the charge density at the nanochannel / nanowire surface, that can be detected as a change in the electrical behaviour of the sensor device (essentially, a depletion of the nanochannel resulting in a change in the channel resistance).</p>

          <p>Blood clot related disease and associated blood coagulation abnormalities cause significant morbidity and mortality in Western society, with stroke being the third leading cause of death in the UK. Early detection of clots is vital. The available therapeutic options informed by early detection and characterisation are greatly enhanced. New technology is essential to address shortcomings in this area. This project will develop a surface acoustic wave based sensor for analysis of blood clotting.
            The project will fabricate the device and test using a range of model fluids.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Since most loads in modern electrical power systems are inductive, there
            is an ongoing interest in improving power factor.  The low power factor of
            inductive loads robs a system of capacity and can adversely affect voltage level.
            As such, power factor correction through the application of capacitors is widely
            practiced at all system voltages.  As utilities increase penalties they charge
            customers for low power factor, system performance will not be the only consideration.</p>
            
            <p>The installation of power factor correction capacitors improves system
            performance and saves money. The aim of this project is to apply a method to improve the power factor using a bank of capacitors.</p>
