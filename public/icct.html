          <p>The Head of Teaching in the College of Engineering is keen to introduce innovation into the courses in Engineering. One of his ideas is to develop a suite of learning activities that could be delivered as Apps on smart phones or tablets. This project will explore the market-place for such applications and develop examples using either the iOs, Android or Web App approach. As an extreme example of the sort of thing that is possible, you might want to check out the Mobile and Tablet apps that are available for Wolfram|Alpha (see http://products.wolframalpha.com/mobile/). Our ambitions would be more limited, but this is an opportunity to use your ICCT skills and try out app development.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Some time ago, an ICCT student developed a web application called Proman that was used during the project allocation process a couple of years ago. Since then, for various reasons, project allocation has moved over to Blackboard. However, in the meantime, developments in web applications technology have moved on considerably. This project will revisit Proman and develop a new project management web app using either Drupal 7 or Ruby on Rails 3. New features worth considering would be the introduction of social networking and peer support features, mobile notifications, etc. An interesting and challenging project for what will be the year of the London Olympics.</p>

          <p>This project will explore the possibilities of using web-based and mobile tools for social networking for building a community in the College of Engineering. A comprehensive survey of existing social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, social tools such as grou.ps and Ning, the Blackboard community pages and self-hosted open-source options such as Moodle, Elgg, Buddypress, and Drupal will be undertaken. The idea will be to find the best platform with which to build an on-line community within the College of Engineering that will be attractive to both the learners and teachers. This project is a follow-on to an earlier project that explored the use of social networking in peer support.</p>

          <p>Spearphishing is a form of phishing and social engineering that aims to deceive a computer user with convincing, personalized email. It is the first stage of an attack to obtain valuable information such as passwords, and has been increasing in popularity in successful attacks that have led to costly data theft for companies and organizations. The project is to (a) experimentally investigate how to harvest personal information from the web about potential targets (b) experimentally measure the effectiveness of spearphishing and other social engineering attacks to obtain valuable personal information.</p>

          <p>Biological systems often demonstrate highly advantageous characteristics, such as self healing, self organization, adaptation, and self learning. Researchers are seeking to apply lessons from biology to improve the design of communication networks. For example, ants are adept at finding the shortest routes to food, which might offer lessons for network routing protocols. The way that the human body heals itself and fights off infections may offer insights for self-healing and secure networks. The project will choose one notable example from biology and demonstrate how biology can lead to improvements in current network design or operation. The improvement should be demonstrated mathematically or by computer simulations.</p>

We have developed a road traffic virtual reality simulator using simple graphics technologies. The aim of this project is to investigate relatively advanced 3D graphics techniques to improve the quality of the graphic properties of the virtual reality simulator. The student will benefit by working with a PhD student already researching in this area. The student is expected to have fairly good skills and interest in programming and simulations.</p>
