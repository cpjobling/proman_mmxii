        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>The Head of Teaching in the College of Engineering is keen to introduce innovation into the courses in Engineering. One of his ideas is to develop a suite of learning activities that could be delivered as Apps on smart phones or tablets. This project will explore the market-place for such applications and develop examples using either the iOs, Android or Web App approach. As an extreme example of the sort of thing that is possible, you might want to check out the Mobile and Tablet apps that are available for Wolfram|Alpha (see http://products.wolframalpha.com/mobile/). Our ambitions would be more limited, but this is an opportunity to use your ICCT skills and try out app development.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Spearphishing is a form of phishing and social engineering that aims to deceive a computer user with convincing, personalized email. It is the first stage of an attack to obtain valuable information such as passwords, and has been increasing in popularity in successful attacks that have led to costly data theft for companies and organizations. The project is to (a) experimentally investigate how to harvest personal information from the web about potential targets (b) experimentally measure the effectiveness of spearphishing and other social engineering attacks to obtain valuable personal information.</p>
