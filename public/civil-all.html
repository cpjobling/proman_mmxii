          <p>This project will developed a simple cross section model of steel usage in the less developed countries, based on the presumption that the inverted U-shaped intensity of use curve is shifted downward over time as a result of steel saving new technology, materials substitution and other time related factors. The model will be used to determine what rate of economic development is required in less developed countries to ensure growth in steel usage within the construction sectors of these economies.

          <p>Since the early 1950’s minimill technologies have diffused to become part of the current steel making climate. For example, the share of electric arc steel production in total world crude steel production has risen steadily from the lows of 15% in 1970 to around 35% in 2002. This trend has had profound implications for the structure of the steel industry around the world. The continuation of this trend will also have significant implications for iron ore and coking coal demand in the longer term.</p>
            
            <p>In this project you will research the reasons for this growth in electric arc steel manufacturing and assess the implication for the future of the large integrated plant. You will also build a model to forecast both steel scrap prices and the future growth of electric arc steel making and derive forecasts up to the year 2015.</p>

          <p>Wastewater processing plays an essential role in modern industry. Design and construction of the hydraulic structure is fundamental to an efficient and effective processing procedure. This requires a clear understanding of the hydraulic flow and its influences to the concrete structure. Also, as a long-term structure and to provide a sustainable solution, the design and construction has to takes into consideration the impact on the surrounding environment.<br/>
            The wastewater hydraulic system consists of water tanks and networking pipes. The pipe flow is regularized and controlled by the hydraulic structure whose mechanical behavior is strongly influenced by the dynamic load from flowing water. The project mainly includes two parts:
            a) Analysis and optimization of pipe flows in the hydraulic system.
            b) Analysis and design of reinforced concrete tanks according to Eurocode.<br/>
            Dr. Mauricio Lobao from Black &amp; Veatch Ltd. (http://www.bv.com/) will be the industrial supervisor, and a few meetings in Black &amp; Veatch Ltd. (Swansea office) may be required.
            The student choosing this project is expected to have a clear understanding of concepts, principles and methods in fluid mechanics and structure mechanics. The project student will face an industry project and benefit from working with professional engineers.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>When the wind blows, a floating object will experience a drag force in the direction of the wind. As the object is induced to drift through the water it will experience a hydrodynamic drag force in the opposite direction. Equilibrium results when the wind-induced aerodynamic drag force is balanced by the hydrodynamic drag force. This occurs at the drift velocity. The ratio of the drift velocity to the wind velocity will depend upon the proportion of the object above and below the waterline.</p>
            
            <p>This project will deal specifically with the induced drift velocity for a floating human body. The work is required for forensic analysis in a criminal investigation. In the first stage, the project will take an experimental approach using the wind tunnel and the water tank available in the School and aim to provide a quick but rough estimation of the drift velocity. In the second stage, a computer simulation approach will be taken (using ANSYS CFX, a commercial computational fluid dynamics package) to confirm the experimental result and obtain more detailed prediction.</p>
            
            <p>The project student is expected to have good knowledge in fluid mechanics, strong ability in experimental investigation, and an interest and open mind of computer simulation.</p>

          <p>The wheelchair is an essential tool for immobile people who wish to travel indoors and out. A reliable wheelchair is essential for accessibility and confidence for the user, failure of the wheelchair frame could cause serious injury and discomfort for the user. A specific problem recognized with wheelchair failure is fatigue fracture in the cross-brace.  It is a problem common with manual folding frame wheelchairs. Fatigue failure causes the chair to be inoperable for the user and could cause serious injury depending on the consequences after the failure. In order to avoid critical failures in wheelchair frames, standards are set for manufacturers to follow, theses involve static strength tests and fatigue tests.</p>
            
            <p>This project will investigate the use of finite element analysis to predict the fatigue strength of a wheelchair frame. Due to the inconsistent nature of fatigue many factors are to be considered when assigning a fatigue strength property. The computer simulation will involve both both static and dynamic analysis. The commercial finite element analysis package “ANSYS” will be used as the main tool in the project.</p>
            
            <p>The project student is required to have solid knowledge in both mechanics and mathematics, with strong motivation to work with real engineering problems. From the project, the student will gain knowledge of using computer simulation to assist analysis and design of complicated engineering structures and receive training of combining techniques to solve real engineering challenges.</p>

          <p>A prestressed membrane structure is a structural form which, due to its own geometrical shape, boundary conditions (supports) and prestressing loads, is subjected only to in-plane tensile forces, thus compressive/shear forces and bending/torsional moments are not present. Tensile membrane structures (possibly in combination with cable nets) are most often used as roofs as they can economically and attractively span large distances (i.e. the O2 Arena in London or the Olympic Stadium in Munich). Form-finding is the process by which an initial shape is obtained in equilibrium with the prestress pattern, prior to the application of in-service loads (i.e. snow, wind). In this project, various form-finding techniques will be investigated, in the context of cable-nets and tensile membranes, and comparisons will be drawn between them in terms of the resulting final shape.</p>

          <p>The objective of this project is the development and coding of an optimisation-based algorithm for the determination of phreatic surfaces for soils subjected to seepage flow. The programming language adopted is MATLAB and the student will start from an existing finite element program for seepage flow analysis in 2-D. The resulting algorithm should produce quadratic rates of asymptotic convergence to the solution (the shape and position of the phreatic surface) which are well above that of simpler algorithms currently described in textbooks.</p>

          Description
        </h3>
        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>Torsion in beams generally arises from the action of shear loads whose point of application does not coincide with the shear centre of the beam section. Codes of Practice require torsional stresses be checked and provided for in design. For general beams, exact solutions of torsion problems normally do not exist and approximate, numerical, methods of analysis must be employed.
              In this project, we will consider a beams of rectangular cross section, and begin by obtaining an exact solution via a separation of variables method. This will enable us to determine the value of the torsional rigidity of the beam.
               We will then solve the same problem using MATLAB and a basic finite difference method. The accuracy of the approximation will be demonstrated by comparing the computed and exact values of the torsional rigidity.
              To finish, we will use a higher order finite difference method and demonstrate its improved accuracy characteristics.</p>

          <p>Water hammer is a pressure surge resulting when water in motion is forced to stop or change direction suddenly. At home, water hammer sometime occurs occur when a tap shuts off water flow, causing a loud repetitive banging or shuddering. The process is often simulated using the method of characteristics.</p>
            
            <pre><code> We will start by looking at the water hammer problem and will produce a one dimensional model in the form of a coupled pair of equations. We will then look at the method of characteristics and use it initially for a single equation. The extension of the method to handle two coupled equations will then be addressed.&#x000A; The method of characteristics will then be applied to the water hammer equations and an approximate MATLAB implementation will be developed. This will then enable simulations to be performed of the flows resulting from the closure of a downstream valve or a change in pipe cross-section or a pipe branch.&#x000A;</code></pre>

          <p>This project will investigate the solution of water wave problems. Analytical solutions to water wave problems are only available for special cases. These analytical solutions can be classified in linear and more accurate non-linear solutions. Approximate solutions can also be obtained by numerical methods such as the boundary element method. This project will extend the work of Level 3 project in 2010/11 to investigate the simulation of progressive water waves using the boundary element method in 2D.</p>

          <p>In engineering computational modelling using finite elements, finite difference or other numerical methods is routinely undertaken to get approximate solutions of complex engineering problems.

Aspects of uncertainty in computational modelling include</p>
            
            <p>• Doubts over whether the mathematical model or equations are correct
            • Doubts over the input data (geometry, material parameters etc)

          <p>The choices of low energy and low carbon lighting are ever-increasing, as is the need to switch to them from traditional incandescent lighting.  Both Australia and the state of California have announced plans to ban their use, and the EU has begun to consider the idea.</p>
            
            <p>At present we predominately just replace one or two primary sources of light in a room with one or two equally bright sources, albeit ones which use less energy.  Solid state lighting can be even more efficient still, but at present not at the highest intensities.  To light a room, the number of light sources would need to be increased, which has implications for how buildings are designed and laid out, and how power is distributed.  In these lower energy forms of lighting, much of the cost is associated with stepping the voltage down from the line voltage to that required in the light source.  Would it be worth designing buildings that also have lower voltage power lines, with one central efficient regulator?</p>
            
            <p>This project will largely be a literature research project, looking in to the physical issues associated with designing buildings to use low-energy forms of lighting, weighing up the merits of different approaches, and suggesting changes to current building design practices which would enable designers to incorporate more energy efficient sources.</p>

            <p>Once built, the v-44 Albatross will be a world outright sailing speed record contender. The v-44 employs sub-cavitating foils comprising of a pair of keels, a rudder and a hydrofoil at the base of the rudder. The boat will demonstrate an upper speed limit, or velocity not to exceed, which is defined by the incipient cavitation speed of these foils. Since the challenge involves setting a new sailing speed record, the onset of foil cavitation must be delayed as far as practically possible.</p>
            
            <p>The objective of this project is to use computational methods (CFD and FEA)to understand the feasibility of designing and building a sub-cavitating keel with an incipient cavitation speed of approximately 70 knots, and to understand the likely performance and limitations of such a keel. The intention is not to produce a final detailed design.</p>

          <p>Throughout the water industry control of the flow of water is fundamental to many processes.

The review should cover a range of processes and compare and contrast the methods that can be used. CFD models should be constructed for a number of techniques. For each technique the model should provide an understanding of the design parameters that control the effectiveness of the technique.</p>

          <p>One of the issues that developers of marine energy devices have to tackle is the way in which the devices are fixed to one location. In the case of tidal stream turbines, the devices may be held in place by drilling and piling into the sea bed or through gravity foundations, but they must be able to withstand the high currents that are present in the deployment locations. Floating wave energy devices are generally moored to the sea-bed, but this has to be done in such a way that will ensure that the motion of the device with respect to the wave climate is not impeded. This project will involve investigating the issues associated with fixing either tidal stream or wave energy devices to their deployment location, and developing a set of rules that should be followed when determining the amount of anchorage required for a particular device.</p>

          <p>Direct time integration is used widely for the solution of large deformation problems in solid and structural mechanics. Direct integration schemes that are unconditionally stable for linear dynamic problems are also used for nonlinear problems. However, unconditional stability may be lost in the nonlinear regime. The Newmark method (trapezoidal rule) is widely used but may become unstable when large deformations and long time durations are considered.</p>
            
            <p>This project will use an existing dynamic nonlinear finite element Fortran code to compare the efficacy of a variety of time-integration schemes for benchmark dynamic nonlinear structural problems.</p>

          <p>Context-sensitive design represents a new way to plan projects in construction. It is an approach that ensures that projects are not only functional and cost-effective, which agreed with the traditional design approach, but are also in harmony with the natural, social and cultural environments. In this context, the student will be required to look into the guidelines and recommendations for housing professionals to meet or exceed energy efficiency requirements issued by the Energy Saving Trust.

            Water scarcity and water pollution are two increasingly pressing problems that could easily and quickly surpass the oil issue. Renewable energy sources can eventually substitute for fossil fuels but freshwater can’t be replaced. This makes the ability to remove toxic contaminants from aquatic environments rapidly, efficiently, and within reasonable costs a significant technological challenge. Nanotechnology could play an important role in this regard. The student will be required to investigate the latest advances in the development of novel nanomaterials with increased affinity, capacity, and selectivity for heavy metals and other contaminants and for the potential remediation of industrial wastewater, groundwater, surface water and drinking water. The student will also investigate the use of coated iron oxide nanoparticles as a sorbent material for removal of heavy metals from water (case study).</p>

          <p>Road traffic simulations are of great interest in many areas including transport planning, congestion prediction and vehicular communications network design. We have developed a road traffic virtual reality simulator using simple graphics technologies. The aim of this project is to investigate relatively advanced 3D graphics techniques to improve the quality of the graphic properties of the virtual reality simulator. The student will benefit by working with a PhD student already researching in this area. The student is expected to have fairly good skills and interest in programming and simulations.</p>

          <p>The removal of hardness to avoid problems is termed as “water-softening”.  Water hardness is mainly caused by the presence of the cations calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) and is partially due to aluminium, iron, and other divalent and trivalent cations. Hardness is considered to be an economical disadvantage as it increases soap consumption and fuel costs. A number of techniques are available for water softening. This project is targeted for students with good background in chemistry. The student is expected to critically review these techniques, analyse water in Swansea  and come up with a suitable technique for  softening.</p>

          <p>In June 2011 parts of England were officially declared in a drought. Although this state of affairs did not last long, this situation shows our increasing susceptibility to water shortages and the vagaries of the weather. For example, England suffered its driest spring in a century, leaving fields parched and many rivers at record lows, whilst Scotland, by contrast, had its wettest spring on record for the three-month period of March, April and May 2011, showing the wide regional variation.</p>
            
            <p>This project will look at how water may be distributed more evenly around the UK and the methods that need to be employed prevent water shortages.</p>

          <p>In 2006-07 the House of Lords Science and Technical Committee in their report on Water Management, recommended that “the Government should consider additional funding to boost research into desalination in the United Kingdom”. This has become more important in recent times as drought is becoming more of a factor due to our drier winters. Indeed on the 2nd of June 2010, a new desalination plant was opened at Beckton.</p>
            
            <p>This project will look at the problems associated with the civil engineering of a desalination plant, such as site selection, layout, brine intake and disposal etc., with particular emphasis on building more plants in the UK.</p>

          <p>Pykrete is a composite material made of approximately 14 percent sawdust or some other form of wood pulp (such as paper) and 86 percent ice by weight. Its use was proposed during World War II by Geoffrey Pyke to the British Royal Navy as a candidate material for making a huge, unsinkable aircraft carrier. Pykrete has some interesting properties, notably its relatively slow melting rate (due to low thermal conductivity), and its vastly improved strength and toughness over unmodified (crystalline) ice, actually closer to concrete.</p>

          <p>Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanotubes are newly fabricated nanomaterials which exhibit exceptional mechanical properties and unique piezoelectric properties. They are promising for a wide range of applications in nanotechnology, e.g., nanosensors, electroemchanical nano-resonators, electron emission devices and reinforcing fibers in super-strong nanocomposites. The vibration of ZnO nanotubes is one of the major concerns in nanomechanics and the design of ZnO nanotube-based NanoMechancialElectrical Systems. Particularly, the nanotubes usually oscillate under initial stresses generated by external gas pressure, mismatch between different materials, or initial external loadings. Such initial stresses will reduce the structural stiffness of the nanotubes and thus significantly change their vibration frequency and associated deformation patterns. As a result, the study of ZnO nanotube vibration with initial stress is of engineering and scientific interest. In this project, the cost–efficient continuum mechanics models will be used to describe the general vibrational behavior of ZnO nanotubes under axial force. The dependence of vibration frequency and associated deformation patterns on the initial stresses will be quantified for various vibration modes by considering the initial stress-induced decrease of the structural stiffness. The outcomes of this project will bring in an in-depth understanding of the effect of initial axial force on ZnO nanotube vibration and provide useful guidance for the design of ZnO nanotube-based nanodevices and nanoelectronics.</p>

          <p>Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanotubes are novel nanomaterials which exhibit exceptional mechanical properties and unique piezoelectric properties. They therefore have great potential to serve as fundamental elements in the 21st century nanotechnology. Their potential applications  include ultrahigh-frequency nano-resonators, electron emission devices and reinforcing fibers in super-strong nanocomposites. These nanotubules are usually of slender and thin structures and work under axial loads due to external gas pressure, mismatch between different materials, or initial external loadings. Such axial stresses will reduce the structural stiffness of ZnO nanotubes and lead to the instability of these nanostructures. Indeed structural instability or buckling of ZnO nanotubes is one of major failure modes, which substantially affects the load-carrying capacity of the nanotubes and may also alter their electrical properties greatly. It is thus of great interest to study the structural instability of axially compressed ZnO nanotubes. In this project the continuum mechanics models will be employed to explore the buckling behavior of ZnO nanotubes due to axial stress. In particular, the nonlocal elastic theory will be used to account for the small scale effect on the buckling of nanotubes and predict the critical buckling loads and associated deformation patterns for the ZnO nanotubes subject to pure axial load. The effect of nanotube size, e.g., radius, length and aspect ratio will be examined in details.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>A new type of hybrid nanowires has been fabricated by coating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with functional nanocrystals. These nanomaterials exhibit exceptional properties, e.g., extreme stiffness, high strength and high electrical conductivity, and thus hold substantial promise for the reinforcing fibers in nanocomposites and the fundamental elements of nanoelectronics and nanodevices, such as ultrahigh-frequency resonators, electron emission devices, and chemical/mechanical sensors. Many of these applications depend crucially on the unique vibration behavior of the novel nanowires. On the other hand, the vibration of the nanowires could threaten structural integrity, impair performance and introduce positional uncertainty in nanostructures. Specifically, the vibration-induced deformation could result in an abrupt change in the electrical and optical properties of the nanowies, which in turn will significantly affect their proper functioning. Thus a thorough understanding of the dynamic behavior is essential for the design and application of the nanowires. Motivated by this idea we shall conduct a detailed study to capture the vibration behavior of the nanowires. To achieve this goal a new model and the mathematic strategy will be developed in the frame work of continuum mechanics to give a reliable description to the interaction between inner CNTs and coating layers. The major attention will be focused on the possible vibration modes, associated vibration frequency and the effect of geometric size (e.g., the inner radius of CNT and the thickness of coating layers) on the vibration of the nanowires. The outputs of the project will significantly advance the knowledge of the overall vibration behavior and deliver a cost-effective model for the novel hybrid nanowires comprising CNTs and various nanocrystals.</p>

          <p>Aluminum Nitride (AlN) nanowires are semiconducting piezoelectric nanomaterials, where applying mechanical load would generate electric voltage and result in the redistribution of electric charge. AlN nanowires thus are promising for the building blocks of the newly proposed nanopiezoelectronics, the smart nanodevices based on the combination of semiconducting and piezoelectric properties at nanoscale. Specifically, due to size reduction to nanometers AlN nanowires exhibit significant surface effect on their piezoelectric responses, i.e., the surface layer(s) will exert influence on the overall piezoelectric properties of the nanowires. Such an effect will lead to unique behaviors, which distinguishes piezoelectric nanostructures from their macroscopic counterparts. The potential applications and distinctive behaviors of  AlN nanowires provide impetus for a comprehensive study of their piezoelectric responses. In this project the new piezoelectric theory will be developed to capture the unique piezoelectric behavior of AlN nanowires due to the significant effect of surface piezoelectricity. This will allow us to accurately and efficiently characterize the general piezoelectric behavior of AlN nanowires and examine the effect of surface layer on the nano-piezoelectricity. The outcomes of the project will provide efficient modeling tools and a database for the future study of nano-piezoelectricity and the development of AlN-based nanopiezoelectronics.</p>

          <p>Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but has previously been geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for direct applications such as home heating. Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of conventional fossil fuels. As a result, it has been claimed that this technology has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed. The aim of the project is to investigate the claims made by the supporters of geothermal power, and evaluate whether or not it is a viable alternative energy source from a civil engineering perspective.</p>

          <p>The production of drinking water from Sea Water is a process that is becoming more and more important. We have seen the construction of desalination plant in London and Paris and we are all aware of the increasing demand and competition for water resources within many parts of the world. Desalination produces fresh water with a by product of concentrated brines that need to be dispossed of. This is often by discharge back in to the oceans. There are useful metal ions found in theses brines that could be recovered. Thus, the processing of brines could be economic and improve the environmental impact of desalination. The student project will examine the methods used to process the brines from the desalination plants. The project will also research the environmental impact and possible remediation methods to recover materials prior to disposal.</p>

(b) Using energy capturing mats at places where traffic needs to slow down. These mats will impede the vehicles and capture their power as electricity. (c) Use small wind turbines along motorway which convert the air thrust generated by fast moving vehicles to electricity.</p>

        <div class='project_desciption'>
          <p>A family of multivariate representations is introduced to capture the input–output relationships of high- dimensional physical systems with many input variables. A systematic mapping procedure between the inputs and outputs is prescribed to reveal the hierarchy of correlations amongst the input variables. It is argued that for most well-defined physical systems, only relatively low-order correlations of the input variables are expected to have an impact upon the output. Correlated function expansion (CFE) utilize this property to present an exact hierarchical representation of the physical system. At each new level of CFE, higher-order correlated effects of the input variables are introduced. This methodology has been widely employed in many applications such as uncertainly propagation, design optimization, and response prediction. But so far the literature related to its application in structural damage identification (SDI) is scarce. Therefore this study attempts to present a systematic SDI procedure comprising four sequential steps of feature selection, parameter screening, primary meta-modeling and updating, and reference-state meta-modeling with SDI realization. The last two steps imply the implementation of inverse problems by model updating in which the meta-models substitute the FE models.</p>

          <p>The amount of currently available fresh water on earth is in continuous decline due to rapidly increased consumption as a result of population growth, industrial use and climate change. According to new findings, one in three people are enduring one form or another of water scarcity. Therefore there is an urgent need to address such world water shortages. Membrane technology increasingly proves to be one of the most practical solutions and the application of nanotechnology to membrane separation processes has shown to be extremely valuable to reduce cost and improve efficiency. This project is targeted for students with Civil Engineering background. The student is expected to critically review the application of nanotechnology to develop novel membranes for application in water treatment.</p>

          <p>The purpose of the project will be to consider simple analytical techniques for analysis of
            circular plates, together with finite element solutions based on the existing software. The
            attention will be restricted to the standard theories for small deflections of elastic plates.
            Analytical solutions will be compared against the results obtained by employing the
            FE software. Particular attention will be given to the choice of finite element models
            that ensure accurate results for a wide range of the thickness to span ratios.</p>

          <p>The purpose of the project will be to consider simple analytical techniques for analysis of

            <p>A simple problem consisting of elasto-plastic bars will be used to illustrate the concepts.
            A small finite element program will be developed for this purpose.</p>
            
            <p>The focus of the second stage of the project will be on problems from engineering practice,
            which allow the analytical solution to be expressed in the closed form. Analytical solutions
            will be compared against the results obtained by employing the commercial FE software.</p>

          <p>The main aim of this project is to gain understanding of the mechanisms involved in
            human touch perception. Surprisingly, touch involves very complex bio-mechanical processes
            and is therefore the least understood of human senses.</p>
            
            <p>This project will look at sensory mechanisms involved in generation of neural signal.
            The research will focus on interaction between the finger pad and textured surfaces during
            pressing and sliding movement. For this purpose, finite element simulations will be used
            to extract the characteristic responses. The simulations will be performed in the
            existing in-house finite element software, so that only a basic background of finite
            element modelling will be required.</p>

          <p>This project will develop a system where students use their student card to 'sign in' to a lecture, recording attendance.<br/>
            University student cards have several methods of identifying themselves.<br/>
            We could explore those and look at recognising student cards and creating an electronic register as an exercise in designing
            building access systems that might be taken on as part of a Civil or Mechanical Engineering design project.</p>
            
            <p>The student will either need some understanding of object-orientated programming, or be willing to learn as part of the project.<br/>
            Some of the development may be in coding the software to drive the card reader, which already exists. However, the brief can
            be adjusted to suit the interests and skills of a Civil or Mechanical Engineer.</p>
